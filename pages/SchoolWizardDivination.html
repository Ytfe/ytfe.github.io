"description":"Hornung, one of the leading wizards in the field of wild magic (before his untimely disappearance while experimenting with wildwind),developed this spell to improve the accuracy of his estimates. The spell provides a wizard with an instant and highly accurate-estimate of the number of persons or objects in a group.

The spell's area effect is one group of a general class of objects. All objects of the group must be within spell range and the group as a whole must be visible to the caster. The wizard need not see every individual in the group, merely the general limits of the group's size and area. For example, a wizard on a hill could look down on a forest and estimate the number of trees in all or part of it. He could not get an estimate of the number of goblins within the forest, however, since the group as a whole is concealed from sight.

The estimate generated is accurate to the largest factor of ten .For example, if Hornung's guess were cast on a group of 439 horsemen, the estimate would be 400. If there were 2,670 horsemen, the spell would estimate 3,000. If there were 37 horsemen, the answer would be 40. Clearly, using the spell on small groups(especially those with fewer than 10 members) is pointless.

Hornung's guess can be used to quickly estimate the size of treasure hoards and army units. It is particularly popular with moneylenders and generals."}</textarea>

"description":"When an identify spell is cast, magical items subsequently touched by the wizard can be identified. The eight hours immediately preceeding the casting of the spell must be spent purifying the items and removing influences that would corrupt and blur their magical auras. If this period is interrupted, it must be begun again. When the spell is cast, each item must be handled in turn by the wizard. Any consequences of this handling fall fully upon the wizard and may end the spell, although the wizard is allowed any applicable saving throw.

The chance of learning a piece of information about an item is equal to 10% per level of the caster, to a maximum of 90%, rolled by the DM. Any roll of 96-00 indicates a false reading (91-95 reveal nothing). Only one function of a multi-function item is discovered per handling (i.e., a 5-th level wizard could attempt to determine the nature of five different items, five different functions of a single item, or any combination of the two). If any attempt at reading fails, the caster cannot learn any more about that item until he advances a level. Note that some items, such as special magical tomes, cannot be identified with this spell.

The item never reveals its exact attack or damage bonuses, although the fact that it has few or many bonuses can be determined. If it has charges, only a general indication of the number of charges remaining is learned: powerful (81% - 100% of the total possible charges), strong (61% - 80%), moderate (41% - 60%), weak (6% - 40%), or faint (five charges or less). The faint result takes precedence, so a fully charges ring of three wishes always appears to be only faintly charged.

After casting the spell and determining what can be learned from it, the wizard loses 8 points of Constitution. He must rest for one hour to recover each point of Constitution. If the 8-point loss drops the spellcaster below a Constitution of 1, he falls unconscious. Consciousness is not regained until full Constitution is restored, which takes 24 hours (one point per three hours for an unconscious character).

The material components of this spell are a pearl (of at least 100gp value) and an owl feather steeped in wine, with the infusion drunk prior to spellcasting. If a luckstone is powdered and added to the infusion, the divination becomes much more potent: exact bonuses or charges can be determined, and the functions of a multi-functional item can be learned from a single reading.

At the DM's option, certain properties of an artifact or relic might also be learned."}</textarea>

Character alignment is not revealed under most circumstances: characters who are strongly aligned, do not stray from their faith, and who are at least 9th level might radiate good or evil if they are intent upon appropriate actions. Powerful monsters, such as ki-rin, send forth emanations of evil or good, even if polymorphed. Aligned undead radiate evil, for it is this power and negative force that enable them to continue existing. An evilly cursed object or unholy water radiates evil, but a hidden trap or an unintelligent viper does not.
 
The degree of evil (faint, moderate, strong, overwhelming) can be noted.

				<div class="description-content">This spell discovers emanations of evil (or of good in the case of the reverse spell) from any creature, object, or area. Character alignment is not revealed under most circumstances: characters who are strongly aligned, do not stray from their faith, and who are at least 9th level might radiate good or evil if they are intent upon appropriate actions. Powerful monsters, such as ki-rin, send forth emanations of evil or good, even if polymorphed. Aligned undead radiate evil, for it is this power and negative force that enable them to continue existing. An evilly cursed object or unholy water radiates evil, but a hidden trap or an unintelligent viper does not.<br /> <br />The degree of evil (faint, moderate, strong, overwhelming) can be noted. <br /><br />Note that priests have a more powerful version of this spell.<br /><br />The spell has a path of detection ten feet wide in the direction in which the mage is facing. The wizard must concentrate - stop, have quiet, and intently seek to detect the aura - for at least one round to receive a reading.</div>

Mobile landmarks, like a King's Crown, automatically fail.

Example: Bobo the diviner casts Locate Landmark, with the landmark in question being the secret burial ground of elves. Bobo is in a human dominated region, where nobody knows the answer to this question, so it returns no answer. Bobo then decides to head to a major port where there are many elves, and casts the spell again. The compass in his hand turns to point North West. Bobo doesn't know how far North West it is, so he travels North West for six days before casting the spell again. This time he is in a small elvan port town that allows human visitors. He casts the spell again, and gets a direction of south west. Bobo knows he's overshot the distance, and can change directions, heading south this time.

A very careful wizard with a compass and map might be able to triangulate the location of a landmark, although this can be tricky since the further the target is from the landmark, the more the compass needle wobbles. "}</textarea>

The second version of the spell has a duration of 1 round / level, during which time the wizard may switch between various masks if they have more than one.

"description":"By casting this spell, the wizard learns what ingredients and formulas were used to create a chemical mixture or magical item.

The information instantly appears in the caster's mind but may be lost if the wizard cannot comprehend it. The caster must roll an Intelligence check; if successful, the wizard understands the formula and retains it in his memory. If the roll is missed, the caster cannot comprehend what he has learned and the information is immediately forgotten. If the spell is cast a second time on the same substance, the spell automatically fails unless the wizard has advanced to the next experience level.

The caster's level determines the type of information gleaned:

5th Level: The type and quantity of ingredients and the preparation process required to produce a non-magical mixture are learned. For example, the wizard could learn how to produce Greek fire or gunpowder, or could learn the recipe for something simple, like chocolate cake.

9th Level: The wizard may learn the proper ingredients and formula for making a magical liquid (potion, scroll ink, etc.).

14th Level: The caster may learn the formula for creating any type of magical object, excluding unique items and objects of extreme power (artifacts and relics).

In all cases, simply knowing the proper formula does not mean the wizard can successfully create the item or material. The construction of alchemical mixtures and magical items is a time consuming and expensive undertaking.

This spell has detrimental effects on the magical item analyzed. Single-use items (potions, oils, etc.) are automatically destroyed; the spell consumes the item in the process of analyzing it. Reusable magical items must make a saving throw vs. disintegration. If the saving throw is failed, Alamir's fundamental breakdown releases the magic of the item in an explosive blast, rendering it permanently nonmagical. The caster suffers 4d8 points of damage from the explosion.

The material component is a wand cut from a 100-year-old oak tree. The wand is used to touch the item in question, and vanishes in a puff of smoke when the spell is complete."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell is coupled with the second level Beacon spell to get the location of a specific beacon. The caster will need a beacon to lock onto, a high quality and accurate map of the region the beacon is suspected to be in, and a crystal lens worth 50gp that is consumed in the casting.

If the beacon was created by the caster, no unusual preparations are needed; but if the beacon was created by another caster, then she must first cast Locate Beacon on the beacon itself. Preparation similar to that of Identify must be undertaken, clearing and cleaning a space, having silence and stillness, and ridding the room of any other magical items. After the cleansing is done, the Locate Beacon spell can be cast on the enchanted object to understand its resonance, and prepare the caster to seek it out later. Once prepared in this way, the caster need never prepare or attune to the beacon again. An Identify spell cast on the enchanted object will also work to link to the beacon.

When a beacon is to be located, a map must be produced and the crystal lens placed on it. The Locate Beacon spell is cast on both the map and the lens (just the one casting) and the caster may then look through the lens at the map to find its location. If the map is detailed and accurate enough, and the beacon is somewhere depicted on the map, it will be seen as a pulsing green light about 1\" in diameter. The beacon is within the area of the light, but not exactly at its center. Two casters locating the same beacon on two different maps, one twice the size of the other and covering the same region, will have two different tolerances. A caster using a desk sized map of the world may only be able to pin the beacon down to a single kingdom. A map of that kingdom might reveal the beacon is in or near a specific city. A map of that city might reveal the beacon is in a neighborhood or perhaps a specific building, depending on specific circumstances.

The map must be well made, well informed, accurate, and precise. Maps of this quality are often at least 100gp in value. 

Beacon and Locate Beacon are often used by powerful merchants and nobles to track larges shipments of money. A single coin may be made a beacon, tossed in with the rest, and if the shipment doesn't get to where it was heading, can be tracked down hopefully before too much is spent or distributed."}</textarea>

"description":"This divination spell allows a number of creatures to understand and be understood by other recipients of this spell. Each creature that is to understand must have their ears touched by the caster, while each of the creatures that is to be understood must have their mouth (or origin of their speech) touched. All subjects of the spell need to be smeared with ink on their forehead (or equivalent) by the caster, and the caster must continue intoning the words to the spell as they move between recipients. During the casting of the spell, none of the recipients that have been marked may leave the AOE, else their ink fades and they are removed from the spell's effects. It is possible to have 2 people who can speak and 10 people who can listen.

When the spell ends, which happens when the duration expires, the caster cancels it, or the caster's light concentration is broken, the ink fades from each of the subjects of the spell.

Example: A diviner wishes to hold an audience with a goblin queen and his party. The goblin queen does not speak common, so the diviner touches the ears of the party members, himself, and the queen, while touching the lips of the queen and himself. All are marked with ink. When the spell takes effect, the goblin will only understand the caster, while the party will understand the goblin. This way the party (caster not included) can speak in common without the goblin understanding, but all can understand the goblin."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">This divination spell allows a number of creatures to understand and be understood by other recipients of this spell. Each creature that is to understand must have their ears touched by the caster, while each of the creatures that is to be understood must have their mouth (or origin of their speech) touched. All subjects of the spell need to be smeared with ink on their forehead (or equivalent) by the caster, and the caster must continue intoning the words to the spell as they move between recipients. During the casting of the spell, none of the recipients that have been marked may leave the AOE, else their ink fades and they are removed from the spell&#039;s effects. It is possible to have 2 people who can speak and 10 people who can listen.<br /><br />When the spell ends, which happens when the duration expires, the caster cancels it, or the caster&#039;s light concentration is broken, the ink fades from each of the subjects of the spell.<br /><br />Example: A diviner wishes to hold an audience with a goblin queen and his party. The goblin queen does not speak common, so the diviner touches the ears of the party members, himself, and the queen, while touching the lips of the queen and himself. All are marked with ink. When the spell takes effect, the goblin will only understand the caster, while the party will understand the goblin. This way the party (caster not included) can speak in common without the goblin understanding, but all can understand the goblin.</div>

While wizard sight is in effect, a wizard is able to see whether someone is a spellcaster and whether that person is a priest or a wizard (and what type of specialist, if any). He can sense if a nonspellcaster has the potential to learn and cast wizard spells (e.g., whether a fighter will someday gain the ability to cast a spell).

Although a spellcaster's level cannot be discerned, the wizard can see the intensity of a spellcaster's aura and guess at the individual's magical power (dim, faint, moderate, strong, overwhelming). This can be extremely ambiguous even when a wizard has some method of comparison; the DM might announce that a subject's intensity is roughly equivalent to that of a companion, or he might announce that a subject's aura is the strongest the wizard has ever encountered.

An object's magical abilities cannot be discerned. The fact that it is magical and the type of magic (abjuration, alteration, etc.) are obvious. The wizard can see the intensity of an item's magical aura and guess at its power, but cannot tell whether a magical item is cursed."}</textarea>

"description":"When this spell is cast, the wizard sends his mind to another plane of existence in order to receive advice and information from powers there. As these powers resent such contact, only brief answers are given. (The DM answers all questions with \"yes,\" \"no,\" \"maybe,\" \"never,\" \"irrelevant,\" etc.) Any questions asked are answered by the power during the spell's duration. The character can contact an elemental plane or some plane farther removed. For every two levels of experience of the wizard, one question may be asked. Contact with minds far removed from the plane of the wizard increases the probability of the spellcaster going insane or dying, but the chance of the power knowing the answer, as well as the probability of the being telling the correct answer, are likewise increased by moving to distant planes. Once the Outer Planes are reached, the Intelligence of the power contacted determines the effects.

The accompanying random table is subject to DM changes, development of extraplanar NPC beings, and so on.

If insanity occurs, it strikes as soon as the first question is asked. This condition lasts for one week for each removal of the plane contacted (see the DMG or the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set), to a maximum of 10 weeks. There is a 1% chance per plane that the wizard dies before recovering, unless a remove curse spell is cast upon him. A surviving wizard can recall the answer to the question.

On rare occasions, this divination may be blocked by the action of certain lesser or greater powers.

Plane               Insanity *  Knowledge  Veracity **
Elemental Plane     20%         55% (90%)  62% (75%)
Inner Plane         25%         60%        65%
Astral Plane        30%         65%        67%
Outer Plane, Int 19 35%         70%        70%
Outer Plane, Int 20 40%         75%        73%
Outer Plane, Int 21 45%         80%        75%
Outer Plane, Int 22 50%         85%        78%
Outer Plane, Int 23 55%         90%        81%
Outer Plane, Int 24 60%         95%        85%
Outer Plane, Int 25 65%         98%        90%

* For every point of Intelligence over 15, the wizard reduces the chance of insanity by 5%.
** If the being does not know an answer, and the chance of veracity is not made, the being will emphatically give an incorrect answer. If the chance of veracity is made, the being will answer “unknown.”

Percentages in parentheses are for questions that pertain to the appropriate elemental plane.

Optional Rule
The DM may allow a specific Outer Plane to be contacted (see the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set). In this case, the difference in alignment between the caster and the plane contacted alters the maximum Intelligence that can be contacted--each difference in moral or ethical alignment lowers the maximum Intelligence that can be contacted by 1. For example, an 18th-level lawful good caster could contact Mount Celestia (a lawful good plane) on the \"Intelligence 20\" line, or Elysium (a neutral good plane) on the \"Intelligence 19\" line."}</textarea>

A surviving wizard can recall the answer to the question.<br /><br />On rare occasions, this divination may be blocked by the action of certain lesser or greater powers.<br /><br />Plane               Insanity *  Knowledge  Veracity **<br />Elemental Plane     20%         55% (90%)  62% (75%)<br />Inner Plane         25%         60%        65%<br />Astral Plane        30%         65%        67%<br />Outer Plane, Int 19 35%         70%        70%<br />Outer Plane, Int 20 40%         75%        73%<br />Outer Plane, Int 21 45%         80%        75%<br />Outer Plane, Int 22 50%         85%        78%<br />Outer Plane, Int 23 55%         90%        81%<br />Outer Plane, Int 24 60%         95%        85%<br />Outer Plane, Int 25 65%         98%        90%<br /><br />* For every point of Intelligence over 15, the wizard reduces the chance of insanity by 5%.<br />** If the being does not know an answer, and the chance of veracity is not made, the being will emphatically give an incorrect answer. If the chance of veracity is made, the being will answer &ldquo;unknown.&rdquo;<br /><br />Percentages in parentheses are for questions that pertain to the appropriate elemental plane.<br /><br />Optional Rule<br />The DM may allow a specific Outer Plane to be contacted (see the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set). In this case, the difference in alignment between the caster and the plane contacted alters the maximum Intelligence that can be contacted--each difference in moral or ethical alignment lowers the maximum Intelligence that can be contacted by 1. For example, an 18th-level lawful good caster could contact Mount Celestia (a lawful good plane) on the &quot;Intelligence 20&quot; line, or Elysium (a neutral good plane) on the &quot;Intelligence 19&quot; line.</div>

"description":"This spell allows the caster to more easily access rare or dangerous spell components. The wizard casts this spell upon a silver mirror while concentrating on a mental image of the material he desires. The base chance of success is 50%, modified by the following factors:

+1% per level of the caster
+10% if the caster has seen the same type of substance or object before; this bonus is not cumulative with the following bonus
+20% if the caster has a sample of the material or the same type of object in his possession; this bonus is not cumulative with the bonus above
+30% if the wizard knows the location of the desired object
-50% if the caster has never seen the same type of material or item before

If the percentile roll indicates failure, the caster is unable to locate the desired ingredient and the spell ends. If the roll indicates success, the wizard has located the object or substance and the mirror becomes a magical gate through which the caster can see the target. The size of the gate is determined by the size of the mirror, to a maximum size of 3 feet by 2 feet.

The gate always appears within arm's length of the target, allowing the wizard to reach through the mirror, grasp the object of his desire, and draw it back through the gate. The wizard must risk his own safety--the gate does not allow the use of probes, long-handled ladles, tongs, or other equipment to gather the material. The caster cannot move completely through the gate.

The gate vanishes when the spell's duration expires or when the target or the wizard moves more than 10' away from it.

The gate is visible from both sides, and other creatures can reach through the gate. Breath weapons, gaze attacks, missiles, spells, and similar attacks cannot be cast through the gate. Because creatures can pass their limbs through the gate, physical attacks and touch spells can be used.

The only limit to the range of this spell is that the caster and the target must be on the same plane of existence. Elemental forces (not creatures) will not pass through the gate. Thus, the wizard does not run the risk of flooding his laboratory by opening a gate beneath the sea, for example. However, the spell does not provide any sort of protection against a hostile environment.

The material components are an exquisite silver mirror of no less than 10,000 gp value and a black opal worth at least 1,000 gp which must be powdered and sprinkled on the mirror. The mirror is not lost after casting and may be used again, but the powdered opal is consumed in the casting."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell conjures a small horde of semi-tangible magical orbs or eyes that can be used to reconnoiter an area at the wizard's command. Each of the eyes is about the size of a small apple and can see 120 feet(normal vision only) in all  direction. In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to the caster's hand to replay in the caster's mind everything they have seen during their existence. The eyes are subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect the wizard's ability to receive visual information about his surroundings. The eyes only see as a normal human would-abilities and spell effects including infravision do not alter the eyes' vision. It only takes the eye one round to replay one hour of recorded images.

The spell conjures 1d4 eyes, plus 1 eye per caster level. The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level, or until they return to the wizard; after relaying its findings, an eye disappears. Each eye is AC 16, flies by levitation at a rate of 12,and has only 1 hit point - a single hit from any weapon or damaging spell destroys it. A successful dispel magic destroys all eyes caught in the area of effect. While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they're small and difficult to spot, especially in conditions of poor visibility such as darkness, fog, or rain. Of course, if the eye is being sent into darkness, then it's very possible that it could hit a wall or other similar obstacle and destroy itself.

When the wizard creates the eyes, he can specify any set of instruction or orders that he wishes, up to 25 words. Any knowledge the wizard possesses is assumed to be know by the eyes as well, so if the wizard knows what a typical Jakallian merchant looks like, the eyes do as well. Sample commands might be, \"Surround me at a range of 400 yards and return if you spot any dangerous creatures,\" or \"Spread out and search the town for Arweth; follow him for three turns, staying out of sight, and then return.\" Note that in the first command, the eye only returns if it spots a creature that the wizard would regard as dangerous; a seemingly innocuous peasant that is actually a shapechanged dragon wouldn't trigger the eye's return. In any event, if an eye is ever more than one mile distant from the wizard, it instantly ceases to exist. However, the wizard's link with the eye is such that he won't know if eye was destroyed or if just wandered out of range.  

Some command words can be used to abbreviate the direction. For example, \"surround me\" directs the eyes to form an equally-spaced ring at whatever range is indicated, and then move with the wizard. As eyes return or are destroyed, the rest automatically space themselves to compensate. \"Spread out\" directs the eyes to move away from the wizard in all directions. Other commands that might be useful include having them form a line in a certain manner, making them move at random within a certain range, or have them follow a certain type of creature. The DM is the final judge of the suitability of the wizard's directions.

The material component is a handful of crystal marbles."}</textarea>

"description":"The legend lore spell is used to determine legendary information regarding a known person, place, or thing. If the person or thing is at hand, or if the wizard is in the place in question, the likelihood of the spell producing results is far greater and the casting time is only 1d4 turns. If only detailed information on the person, place, or thing is known, casting time is 1d10 days. If only rumors are known, casting time is 2d6 weeks.

During the casting, the wizard cannot engage in activities other than the routine: eating, sleeping, etc. When completed, the divination reveals if legendary material is available. It often reveals where this material is--by place name, rhyme, or riddle. It sometimes gives certain information regarding the person, place, or thing (when the object of the legend lore is at hand), but this data is always in some cryptic form (rhyme, riddle, anagram, cipher, sign, etc.). Naturally, a legend lore spell reveals information only if the person, place, or thing is noteworthy or legendary.

For example, suppose Delsenora came across an extremely well-made sword. It radiates magic, but when she used an identify spell, she could not learn any information. Even giving it to a trusted fighter didn't work, as the sword did not reveal any special powers. Finally, she casts a legend lore spell, hoping to gain more information. Since the sword is at hand, she completes the spell in three turns. In her mind comes the message, \"Once this was the sword of he who waits till Albion's time of greatest peril, when unto his hand it shall fly again. Fair was the hand that gave me and fair was the hand that reclaimed me.\" Clearly, Delsenora realizes, this must be a very powerful item, since her spell gave only a cryptic answer. But who is he who waits? And where is Albion? For more information, Delsenora is going to have to cast more spells. But now the process will take much longer, since she has only the vaguest of clues to follow.

The legend lore spell is cast with incense and strips of ivory formed into a rectangle, but some item of value to the caster must be sacrificed in addition--a potion, magical scroll, magical item, etc."}</textarea>

But now the process will take much longer, since she has only the vaguest of clues to follow.<br /><br />The legend lore spell is cast with incense and strips of ivory formed into a rectangle, but some item of value to the caster must be sacrificed in addition--a potion, magical scroll, magical item, etc.</div>

"description":"To prepare for this spell, the caster must build a very hot fire. This can be through making a large fire, or a small fire of materials that burn very hot. The caster must also have an amount of sand on hand. Once the fire has reached the required intensity, the caster imbues a handful of sand with the magic of the spell and tosses it into the flames where they are quickly and brightly incinerated in an instant, and altering the flames to act as a window into the past. 

Any who look upon the flames will see the same event or location as if viewed through a window whose shape flickers with the flame. The caster chooses a location and a time when enchanting the first handful of sand, and can change location and time with each subsequent imbued handful they add to the fire.

The location must be public, something generally accessible to anyone, unless the caster adds to the fire a flammable personal affect of a specific person whose past they wish to view. The item should be relatively whole and personal in nature. Alternatively, a drop of blood or the root of a hair, freshly procured in the last 24 hours, may be used in lieu of a personal item. The location can be changed with a handful of sand. Regardless whether the caster is viewing a public area, or a specific person, a room lined with lead or silver will block the spell and the caster will see nothing but flames.

The time frame is limited to the past, viewed in real time, and limited to increments of exactly 1 year. Should a caster wish to view the events of the previous day, they would have to wait a year minus a day to see them. The time may be changed with a handful of sand to any increment of 1 year that they wish.

Postcognition can be channeled for as long as the caster is no more than 15 from the flames, their intensity is maintained, and the caster maintains concentration on the spell. They may converse with those around them as long as it is about what is happening in the fires. Other conversation is too distracting and will cause the caster to falter. Taking damage requires making a saving throw to maintain concentration.

Because the onlooker sees the events only where flames are, one bigger or closer the flames, the better view the onlooker will have. Frequent users of this spell often have singed hairs and small burns on themselves, as well as a distant and unchanging gaze that feels removed from the world."}</textarea>
