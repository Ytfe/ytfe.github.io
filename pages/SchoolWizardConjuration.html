"description":"By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical field of force that serves as if it were scale mail armor (+4AC). The spell has no effect on a person already armored or a creature with Armor Class 14 or better. It is not cumulative with the shield spell, but it is cumulative with Dexterity and, in the case of fighter/mages, with the shield bonus. The armor spell does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, nor does it prevent spellcasting. It lasts until successfully dispelled or until the wearer sustains cumulative damage totaling greater than 8 points + 1 per level of the caster. (It is important to note that the armor does not absorb this damage. The armor merely grants an AC of 14; the wearer still suffers full damage from any successful attacks.) Thus, the wearer might suffer 8 points from an attack, then several minutes later sustain an additional 1 point of damage. Unless the spell were cast by a wizard of 2nd level or higher, it would be dispelled at this time. Until it is dispelled, the armor spell grants the wearer full benefits of the Armor Class gained.

"description":"This spell enables the caster to attempt to summon a familiar to act as his aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures, such as cats, frogs, ferrets, crows, hawks, snakes, owls, ravens, toads, weasels, or even mice. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with him, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well. A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, however he has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any at all come. 

The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically 2 or 3 Int points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The wizard receives the heightened senses of his familiar, which grants the wizard a +1 bonus to all surprise die rolls. Normal familiars have 2-4 hit points plus 1 hit point per caster level, and an Armor Class of 7 (due to size, speed, etc.).

The wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands at a distance of up to one mile. Note that empathic responses from the familiar are generally fairly basic - while able to communicate simple thoughts, these are often overwhelmed by instinctual responses. Thus a ferret familiar spying on a band of orcs in the woods might lose its train of thought upon sighting a mouse. Certainly its communications to its master would be tinged with fear of the \"big ones\" it was spying on! The caster cannot see through the familiar's eyes.

If separated from the caster, the familiar loses 1 hit point each day, and dies if reduced to 0 hit points. When the familiar is in physical contact with its wizard, it gains the wizards saving throws against special attacks. If a special attack would normally cause damage, the familiar suffers no damage if the saving throw is successful and half damage if the saving throw is failed. 

If the familiar dies, the wizard must successfully roll an immediate system shock check or die. Even if he survives this check, the wizard loses 1 point from his Constitution when the familiar dies.

The power of the conjuration is such that it can be attempted but once per year. When the wizard decides to find a familiar, he must load a brass brazier with charcoal. When this is burning well, he adds 1.000 gp worth of incense and herbs. The spell incantation is then begun and must be continued until the familiar comes or the casting time is finished. The DM secretly determines all results. Note that most familiars are not inherently magical, nor does a dispel magic spell send them away.

Deliberate mistreatment, failure to feed and care for the familiar, or continuous unreasonable demands have adverse effects on the familiar's relationship with its master. Purposely arranging the death of one's own familiar incurs great disfavor from certain powerful entities, with dire results.

On a d20 roll of 1-5 a black Cat is summoned, granting excellent night vision & superior hearing
On a d20 roll of 6-7 a Crow is summoned, granting excellent vision
On a d20 roll of 8-9 a Hawk is summoned, granting very superior distance vision
On a d20 roll of 10-11 a Owl is summoned, granting night vision equal to human daylight vision and superior hearing
On a d20 roll of 12-13 a Toad is summoned, granting wide-angle vision
On a d20 roll of 14-15 a Weasel is summoned, granting superior hearing & very superior olfactory power
On a d20 roll of 16-20 no familiar is available within spell range

The referee can substitute other small animals suitable to the area."}</textarea>

Those who successfully save can reach the nearest non-greased surface by the end of the round. Those who remain in the area are allowed a saving throw each round until they escape the area. The DM should adjust saving throws by circumstance; for example, a creature charging down an incline that is suddenly greased has little chance to avoid the effect, but its ability to exit the affected area is almost assured! 

The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item - a rope, ladder rungs, weapon handle, etc. 
Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while creatures wielding or employing items receive a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw is failed, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made each round the creature attempts to use the greased item. 

The caster can end the effect with a single utterance; otherwise it lasts for three rounds plus one round per level. 
The material component of the spell is a bit of pork rind or butter."}</textarea>

"description":"The caster creates a circle on a stable surface with chalk and powered silver or lead. The size of the circle dictates how much chalk, silver, and lead is needed, as well as the casting time. Each foot of diameter consumes 30cp worth of lead or 60cp worth of silver and takes 2 minutes to create. Once the circle is created, the spell takes 1 minute to cast.

Once the circle is drawn and the spell is cast, nothing (physical or magical) may cross the boundary within the circle. If the chalk and powder circle is broken (a hair or straw laying across it, or being scuffed, for example), the spell is instantly broken. Items or creatures may be summoned within the circle, preventing them from running free, but also preventing the caster, or others, from interacting with the creature. While touch and spells may not cross the border, non-magical sounds may.

A creature inside the circle may attempt to break out. To do so, the creature rolls a d10 and adds their willpower and their number of hit dice. The spellcaster rolls the same thing. If the creature's roll equals or beats the caster's, the creature breaks free of the circle. If the circle is made with silver, instead of lead, the caster has advantage on the d10 roll. When this spell is broken in this way, there is a short but blinding flash of light outside the circle.

This circle may be reused over and over, as long as it is not disturbed. A permanent magic circle can be made at 100x the cost. The permanent version of this circle uses inlaid stones and molten metals.

The spell, but not the physical circle, may be dispelled by the original caster with a touch."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">The caster creates a circle on a stable surface with chalk and powered silver or lead. The size of the circle dictates how much chalk, silver, and lead is needed, as well as the casting time. Each foot of diameter consumes 30cp worth of lead or 60cp worth of silver and takes 2 minutes to create. Once the circle is created, the spell takes 1 minute to cast.<br /><br />Once the circle is drawn and the spell is cast, nothing (physical or magical) may cross the boundary within the circle. If the chalk and powder circle is broken (a hair or straw laying across it, or being scuffed, for example), the spell is instantly broken. Items or creatures may be summoned within the circle, preventing them from running free, but also preventing the caster, or others, from interacting with the creature. While touch and spells may not cross the border, non-magical sounds may.<br /><br />A creature inside the circle may attempt to break out. To do so, the creature rolls a d10 and adds their willpower and their number of hit dice. The spellcaster rolls the same thing. If the creature&#039;s roll equals or beats the caster&#039;s, the creature breaks free of the circle. If the circle is made with silver, instead of lead, the caster has advantage on the d10 roll. When this spell is broken in this way, there is a short but blinding flash of light outside the circle.<br /><br />This circle may be reused over and over, as long as it is not disturbed.

The swarm cannot be fought effectively with weapons, but fire and area effects can force it to disperse by inflicting damage. The swarm disperses when it has taken a total of 2 hit points per caster level from these attacks. 

A protection from evil spell keeps the swarm at bay, and certain area-effect spells, such as gust of wind and stinking cloud, disperse a swarm immediately, if appropriate to the swarm summoned (e.g., only flyers are affected by a gust of wind). 

The caster must remain stationary and undisturbed to control the swarm; if his concentration lapses or is broken, the swarm disperses in two rounds. The swarm is stationary once conjured.

The swarm disperses when it has taken a total of 2 hit points per caster level from these attacks. <br /><br />A protection from evil spell keeps the swarm at bay, and certain area-effect spells, such as gust of wind and stinking cloud, disperse a swarm immediately, if appropriate to the swarm summoned (e.g., only flyers are affected by a gust of wind). <br /><br />The caster must remain stationary and undisturbed to control the swarm; if his concentration lapses or is broken, the swarm disperses in two rounds. The swarm is stationary once conjured.<br /><br />The material component is a square of red cloth.</div>

"description":"When this spell is cast, the wizard creates a quasi-real, horse-like creature. The steed can be ridden only by the wizard who created it, or by any person for whom the wizard specifically creates such a mount.

A phantom steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound. Its eyes are milky-colored. It does not fight, but all normal animals shun it and only monstrous ones will attack. The mount has an Armor Class of 2 and 7 hit points, plus 1 per level of the caster. 

If it loses all of its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed moves at a movement rate of 4 per level of the spellcaster, to a maximum movement rate of 48. It has what seems to be a saddle and a bit and bridle. 

It can bear its rider's weight, plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.

These mounts gain certain powers according to the level of the wizard who created them:

8th Level: The ability to pass over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty.

10th Level: The ability to pass over water as if it were firm, dry ground.

12th Level: The ability to travel in the air as if it were firm land, so chasms and the like can be crossed without benefit of a bridge. Note, however, that the mount cannot casually take off and fly; the movement must be between points of similar altitude. 

14th Level: The ability to perform as if it were a pegasus; it flies at a rate of 48 per round upon command.

Note that a mount's abilities include those of lower levels; thus a 12th-level mount has the 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-level abilities.

Its attack is made as if it were a monster with Hit Dice equal to the level of the wizard who cast the spell. If it strikes successfully, the victim is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force, frozen and immobilized until released, either at the caster's command, by a successful dispel magic spell, or until a time equal to 1d4 days + 1 day per caster level has elapsed.

Until then, nothing can get at the victim, move the shimmering force surrounding him, or otherwise affect him. The victim does not age, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells while in this state. He is not aware of his surroundings.

If the sepia snake misses its target, it dissipates in a flash of brown light, with a loud noise and a puff of dun-colored smoke that is 10 feet in diameter and lasts for one round.

The spell cannot be detected by normal observation, and detect magic reveals only that the entire text is magical. A dispel magic can remove it; an erase spell destroys the entire page of text. It can be cast in combination with other spells that hide or garble text.

"description":"This spell conjures a corrosive, acidic slime of horrid strength on one surface or creature within the spell's range. Up to one square foot of surface area per caster level can be affected, so a 5th-level caster can affect 5 square feet - enough to create a 2-foot by 3-foot hole in a door or wall, or thoroughly drench a man-sized creature. The acid eats through 6 inches of wood, leather, or bone, 4 inches of stone, or 1 inch of metal each round. 

Against monsters composed of stone, metal or wood, the solvent inflicts 1d3 points of damage per caster level in the first round, 1d2 per caster level in the second round, and 1 per two caster levels in the third and final round. 

Therefore, a 10th-level wizard who strikes a Treant with solvent of corrosion inflicts 10d3, then 10d2 and finally 5 points of damage. Each round, the victim is allowed a saving throw vs. spell for half damage.

Against flesh, the solvent is much less effective; it is caustic and burns painfully, inflicting 1 point of damage per caster level in the first round, but no further damage in the second or third round. However, the burning in the following rounds does inflict a -2 penalty to the victim's attacks while the solvent is active. 

The solvent is extremely likely to cause extensive damage to the victim's armor and equipment; item saving throws vs. acid may apply at the DM's discretion. If the armor or equipment is magical in nature, then the saving throws is made with the usual bonuses allowed to the magical item.

The great alchemist Vandarien developed his solvent to dissolve iron grates, stone and woodwork traps, and other such hazards. The solvent's effectiveness against mineral or wood-based creatures was a mere side effect of his research. The material component of this spell is a mixture of vinegar, water, and a drop of black dragon acid."}</textarea>

Semi-magical creatures get a +5 bonus to their roll, magical creatures get a +10, highly magical creatures get a +15. Natural 1s and 20s have no effect on this roll.

If the creature successfully bursts the spell, it becomes free willed and usually very angry at the summoner, who it will probably try to destroy.

Striking the watery double while it is wrapped around its victim causes an equal amount of damage to the victim. Part water, lower water, and transmute water to dust spells instantly destroy a watery double.</div>

"description":"This spell is effective only on the night of a full moon and one night immediately preceeding and following it.

For the spell to be effective, the caster and the lycanthrope must be on the same plane of existence; there is no other range limitation. When the spell is cast, the nearest lycanthrope (as determined by the DM) of the chosen species must attempt a saving throw. If successful, the creature is unaffected. If it fails, the lycanthrope instantly appears near the caster.

Upon arrival, the creature can freely attack the wizard unless the caster has created a warding circle. If a circle is present, the lycanthrope appears in the circle; otherwise, it appears Id10 feet away from the caster in a random direction (the DM should use the scatter diagram for grenadelike missiles found in the Dungeon Master Guide to determine direction).

A warding circle is a temporary prison drawn with specially prepared pigments laced with silver filings. These pigments cost 100 gp for each foot of diameter of the circle (thus, a circle 10 feet across costs 1,000 gp). A warding circle must be at least 5 feet in diameter; if smaller, the lycanthrope is automatically freed. Preparing the circle takes one turn per foot of diameter.

Even with such protection, the lycanthrope can break out of the circle and wreak vengeance upon the summoner. The creature"}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">This spell is effective only on the night of a full moon and one night immediately preceeding and following it.<br /><br />For the spell to be effective, the caster and the lycanthrope must be on the same plane of existence; there is no other range limitation. When the spell is cast, the nearest lycanthrope (as determined by the DM) of the chosen species must attempt a saving throw. If successful, the creature is unaffected. If it fails, the lycanthrope instantly appears near the caster.<br /><br />Upon arrival, the creature can freely attack the wizard unless the caster has created a warding circle. If a circle is present, the lycanthrope appears in the circle; otherwise, it appears Id10 feet away from the caster in a random direction (the DM should use the scatter diagram for grenadelike missiles found in the Dungeon Master Guide to determine direction).<br /><br />A warding circle is a temporary prison drawn with specially prepared pigments laced with silver filings. These pigments cost 100 gp for each foot of diameter of the circle (thus, a circle 10 feet across costs 1,000 gp). A warding circle must be at least 5 feet in diameter; if smaller, the lycanthrope is automatically freed. Preparing the circle takes one turn per foot of diameter.<br /><br />Even with such protection, the lycanthrope can break out of the circle and wreak vengeance upon the summoner. The creature</div>

"description":"There are actually four spells in the conjure elemental spell. 

The wizard is able to conjure an air, earth, fire, or water elemental with this spell - assuming he has the material component for the particular elemental. (A considerable fire source must be in range to conjure a fire elemental; a large amount of water must be available to conjure a water elemental.) Conjured elementals have 8 Hit Dice.

It is possible to conjure successive elementals of different types if the spellcaster has memorized two or more of these spells. The type of elemental to be conjured must be decided upon before memorizing the spell. Each type of elemental can be conjured only once per day.

The conjured elemental must be controlled by the wizard - the spellcaster must concentrate on the elemental doing his commands - or it turns on the wizard and attacks. The elemental will not break off a combat to do so, but it will avoid creatures while seeking its conjurer. If the wizard is wounded or grappled, his concentration is broken. 

There is always a 5% chance that the elemental turns on its conjurer regardless of concentration. This check is made at the end of the second and each succeeding round.

An elemental that breaks free of its control can be dispelled by the caster, but the chance of success is only 50%. The elemental can be controlled up to 30 yards away per level of the spellcaster. The elemental remains until its form on this plane is destroyed due to damage or until the spell's duration expires. 

Note that water elementals are destroyed if they are ever more than 60 yards from a large body of water.

The material component of the spell (besides the quantity of the element at hand) is a small amount of one of the following:
    Air Elemental - burning incense
    Earth Elemental - soft clay
    Fire Elemental - sulphur and phosphorus
    Water Elemental - water and sand

Special protection from uncontrolled elementals is available by means of a protection from evil spell."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell enables a specially constructed chest to be hidden deep within the Ethereal Plane, to be summoned using a small model of the chest. The large chest must be exceptionally well-crafted and expensive, constructed for the caster by master craftsmen. If made principally of wood, it must be ebony, rosewood, sandalwood, teak, or the like, and all of its corner fittings, nails, and hardware must be platinum. If constructed of ivory, the metal fittings of the chest must be gold. If the chest is fashioned from bronze, copper, or silver, its fittings must be electrum or silver. The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, the wizard must have a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail) made, so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. One wizard can have but one pair of these chests at any given time--even wish spells do not allow exceptions! The chests themselves are nonmagical, and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest.

While touching the chest and holding the tiny replica, the caster chants the spell. This causes the large chest to vanish into the Ethereal Plane. The chest can contain 1 cubic foot of material per level of the wizard no matter what its apparent size. Living matter makes it 75% likely that the spell fails, so the chest is typically used for securing valuable spell books, magical items, gems, etc. As long as the spellcaster has the small duplicate of the magical chest, he can recall the large one from the Ethereal Plane whenever the chest is desired. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, not even with a wish spell, that the large chest can return, although an expedition might be mounted to find it.

While the chest is in the Ethereal Plane, there is a cumulative 1% chance per week that some being finds it. This chance is reset to 1% whenever the chest is recalled and the spell recast to return it to the Ethereal Plane. If the chest is found, the DM must work out the encounter and decide how the being reacts to the chest (for example, it might ignore the chest, fully or partially empty it, or even exchange or add to the items present!).

Whenever the secret chest is brought back to the Prime Material Plane, an ethereal window is opened for a variable amount of time (usually about one turn); the window slowly diminishes in size. When this hole opens between the planes, check for an ethereal encounter to see if a monster is drawn through.

If the large chest is not retrieved before the spell duration lapses, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest is lost."}</textarea>

"description":"By means of this spell, the wizard summons up a phantom watchdog that only he can see. He may then command it to perform as guardian of a passage, room, door, or similar space or portal. The phantom watchdog immediately commences a loud barking if any creature larger than a cat approaches the place it guards. As the faithful hound is able to detect invisible creatures and ward against the approach of ethereal creatures, it is an excellent guardian. It does not react to illusions that are not at least quasi-real.

If the intruding creature exposes its back to the watchdog, the dog delivers a vicious attack as if it were a 10-Hit Dice monster, striking for 3d6 points of damage. It is able to hit opponents of all types, even those normally subject only to magical weapons of +3 or greater. Creatures without backs (for example, ochre jellies) are not attacked. The faithful hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled. The spell lasts for a maximum of one hour plus half an hour per caster level, but once it is activated by an intruder, it lasts only one round per caster level. If the spellcaster is ever more than 30 yards distant from the area that the watchdog guards, the spell ends.

The material components of this spell are a tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a thread."}</textarea>

"description":"By casting this inherently evil spell, the wizard conjures a small amount of deadly poison directly onto any weapon blades or other surface within the area of effect. The spell creates one dose per caster level; a single dose is sufficient to coat one size S weapon such as a dagger or an arrowhead, three doses can coat a size M weapon, and five doses can coat a size L weapon. The venom remains potent for up to one hour per caster level, although an envenomed blade remains so for only 1d3 successful attacks before the poison has been worn off. The potency of the venom varies by the caster level, as shown below.(See book for table).

If a weapon coated with Vandarien's vile venom successfully hits a creature, the victim must make a saving throw vs. poison or suffer the first damage figure - if the caster was a 12th-level wizard, this would be 25 points. (Naturally, this is damage above and beyond any caused by the weapon that injects the poison.) Even if he succeeds in the save, the victim still sustains a lesser amount of damage, as shown in the second figure.

Instead of creating an insinuative poison (one that is introduced to the body through a cut), the wizard can instead conjure the venom as a contact poison. A surface of about one-half square foot per caster level can be affected. One square foot is enough to coat a doorknob, a sword-hilt, the handle or clasp of a chest, or an object of similar size. The contact poison has the same effects as the insinuative venom, but the victim gains a +2 bonus on his saving throws. The contact poison’s toxicity fades at the end of the spell’s duration.

"description":"Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a powerful creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap, where it will be held until it agrees to perform one service in return for freedom from the ensnarement spell. The type of creature to be ensnared must be known and stated, and if it has a specific, proper, or given name, this must be used in casting the ensnarement spell. The spell causes an awareness of a gatelike opening on the plane of the creature to be ensnared. A special saving throw is then made to determine if the creature detects the nature of the planar opening as a trap or believes it to be a gate. To save, the creature must roll equal to or less than its Intelligence score on 1d20. The score is modified by the difference between the creature's Intelligence and that of the spellcaster. If the creature has a higher score, the difference is subtracted from its dice roll to save. If the spellcaster has a higher score, the difference is added to the dice roll.

If the saving throw succeeds, the creature ignores the spell-created opening, and the spell fails. If the saving throw fails, the creature steps into the opening and is ensnared.

When so trapped, the otherplanar creature can freely attack the ensnaring wizard, unless the caster has created a warding circle. Such circles may be temporary (drawn by hand) or permanent (inlaid or carved). Even with such protection, the entrapped creature may break free and wreak its vengeance upon the spellcaster.

A hand-drawn circle has a base failure chance of 20%, while one inlaid or carved has a base of 10% (and that is for the first time it is used, to determine whether or not the job was done properly). The base chance is modified by the difference between the wizard's combined Intelligence and experience level and the Intelligence and the experience level or Hit Dice of the creature ensnared. If the spellcaster has a higher total, that difference in percentage points is subtracted from the chance for the creature to break free. If the creature has a higher total, that difference is added to its chance to break free.

The chance can be further reduced by careful preparation of the circle. If the handmade circle is drawn over a longer period of time, using specially prepared pigments (1,000 gp value per turn spent drawing), the chance of breaking free is reduced by 1% for every turn spent in preparation. This can bring the base chance to 0%.

Similarly, an inlaid or carved design can be brought to a 0% chance of the creature breaking free by inlaying with various metals, minerals, etc. This cost will require a minimum of one full month of time and add not less than 50,000 gp to the basic cost of having the circle inlaid or carved into stone. Any break in the circle spoils the efficacy of the spell and enables the creature to break free automatically. Even a straw dropped across the line of a magic circle destroys its power. Fortunately, the creature within cannot so much as place a straw upon any portion of the inscribed ward, for the magic of the barrier absolutely prevents it.

Once safely ensnared, the creature can be kept for as long as the spellcaster dares. (Remember the danger of something breaking the ward!) The creature cannot leave the circle, nor can any of its attacks or powers penetrate the barrier. The caster can offer bribes, use promises, or make threats in order to exact one service from the captive creature.

The DM will then assign a value to what the wizard has said to the ensnared creature, rating it from 0 to 6 (with 6 being the most persuasive). This rating is then subtracted from the Intelligence score of the creature. If the creature rolls a successful Intelligence check against its adjusted Intelligence, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, etc., can be made, or the old ones re-offered 24 hours later, when the creature's Intelligence has dropped by 1 point due to confinement. This can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until the caster decides to get rid of it by means of some riddance spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to.

Once the single service is completed, the creature need only so inform the spellcaster to be instantly sent from whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge."}</textarea>

"description":"When this spell is cast, the wizard teleports some desired item from virtually any location directly to his hand. The single object can be no longer in any dimension than a sword, can have no more weight than a shield (about eight pounds), and must be nonliving.

To prepare this spell, the wizard must hold a gem of not less than 5,000gp value in his hand and utter all but the final word of the conjuration. At some point in the future, he must crush the gem and utter the final word. The desired item is then transported instantly into the spellcaster's right or left hand, as he desires.

The item must have been previously touched during the initial incantation and specifically named; only that particular item is summoned by the spell. During the initial incantation, the gem becomes magically inscribed with the name of the item to be summoned. The inscription is invisible and unreadable, except by means of a read magic spell, to all but the wizard who cast the summons.

If the item is in the possession of another creature, the spell does not work, and the caster knows who the possessor is and roughly where he, she, or it is located when the summons is cast. Items can be summoned from other planes of existence, but only if such items are not in the possession (not necessarily the physical grasp) of another creature. For each level of experience above the 14th, the wizard is able to summon a desired item from one plane farther removed from the plane he is in at the time the spell is cast (one plane away at 14th level, two planes away at 15th, etc.). Thus, a wizard of 16th level could cast the spell even if the desired item was on the second layer of one of the Outer Planes, but at 14th level the wizard would be able to summon the item only if it were no farther than one of the Inner Planes, the Ethereal Plane, or the Astral Plane (see the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set). Note that special wards or barriers, or factors that block the teleport or plane shift spells, may also block the operation of this spell. Objects in Leomund's secret chest cannot be recovered by using this spell.

Note: If the item is wizard marked, it can be summoned from anywhere on the same plane unless special local conditions apply. Furthermore, the details of the location of the item are more specific, and the item is more easily traceable with other types of scrying magic."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell conjures into existence seven magical orbs that float above the caster’s head in a ring about 5 feet in diameter. The eyes remain for 1 round per level, or until the caster chooses to either expend the orb by using it in attack or defense. In addition, as long as at least one eye is still in existence, the caster gains 360° vision and can detect invisibility and detect phase at will, with a 60-foot range. The powers of each eye are described below.

Eye of the Mind. This orb protects the caster against mental attack, charm, or influence, including charm, beguiling, hold, and emotion effects. The first such attack is negated by the orb and destroys it in turn. If the wizard desires, the eye of the mind can instead be used to charm person like the 1st-level wizard spell, although this also expends the orb.

Eye of the Sword. This eye deflects the first physical attack that endangers the caster, including hand-held or missile attacks, and then disappears. The wizard can also employ the eye of the sword to create five magical blades that strike as magic missiles for 1d4+1 points of damage each. (Knockdown d6, medium (1 hit) impact)

Eye of the Mage. One manifestation of raw energy, such as lightning, fire, force, cold, or a similar effect, is absorbed by the eye of the mage. The eye can also project a 60-foot long by 5-foot wide lightning bolt that inflicts 4d8 damage (saving throw vs. spell for half damage) to all in its path. Either use expends the eye’s power. (Knockdown d12, large (1-3 hits) electricity)

Eye of Venom. This eye can be used to halt any one attack or effect that could poison the caster. In the case of an attacker armed with an envenomed weapon, the caster may decide to expend either the eye of venom or the eye of swords in order to block the attack. The eye can also be used to poison one creature within 30 feet; the victim must make a saving throw vs. poison or die in one round.

Eye of the Spirit. The first attack that affects the victim’s life energy, including energy drain, strength drain, cause wounds, trap the soul, magic jar, or death is parried by the eye of the spirit. The wizard may instead choose to expend the eye’s power by casting enervation (see the 4th-level wizard spell) upon one target within 30 feet.

Eye of Artifice. This eye deflects and is destroyed by the first attack directed at the caster from a magical device. If the attack also takes a form that may be blocked by another eye (for example, the bolt from a wand of lightning) the caster may choose which eye is expended. If used to attack instead, the eye of artifice functions as a dispel magic cast at 8th level.

Eye of Stone. This eye offers protection against the first attack that could petrify the caster and then vanishes. It can also be expended to cast hold person.

Although any number of eyes can defend the wizard in the course of a single round, only one eye may be used to attack per round. When the caster uses an eye to attack, he may not cast a spell, attack physically, or employ another magical item in the same round; willing the eye to discharge its energies requires his complete concentration. Eye attacks are considered to have an initiative modifier of 1 or a speed of very fast in the Player’s Option: Combat & Tactics initiative system.

The material component is seven blessed gemstones worth at least 50gp each."}</textarea>

   Death One or more creatures, whose total hit points do not exceed 80, are slain. Discord All creatures are affected   and  immediately fall to loud bickering and
arguing; there is a 50% probability that creatures of different alignments attack each other. The bickering lasts for 5d4 rounds, the fighting for 2d4 rounds.

Hopelessness All creatures are affected and must turn back in dejection unless they save vs. spell. Affected creatures submit to the demands of any opponent--for example, surrender, get out, etc. The hopelessness lasts for 3d4 turns; during this period it is 25% probable that affected creatures take no action during any round, and 25% likely that those taking action turn back or retire from battle, as applicable.
   Insanity One or more creatures whose total hit points do not exceed 120 become insane and remain so, acting as if a confusion spell had been placed upon them, until a heal, restoration, or wish spell is used to remove the
madness. 
    Pain All creatures are afflicted with wracking pains shooting through their bodies, causing a -2 penalty to Dexterity and a -4 penalty to attack rolls for 2d10 turns.
    Sleep All creatures under 8+1 Hit Dice immediately fall into a catatonic slumber and cannot be awakened for 1d12+4 turns
     Stunning One or more creatures whose total hit points do not exceed 160 are stunned and reeling for 3d4 rounds, dropping anything they are holding. The type of symbol cannot be recognized without being read and thus activating its
effects.
    The material components of this spell are powdered black opal and diamond dust,worth not less than 5,000 gp each."}</textarea>

"description":"  This spell forces the creature's life force (and its material body) into a special prison gem enchanted by the spellcaster. The creature must be seen by the caster when the final word is uttered.
  The spell can be triggered in one of two ways. First, the final word of the spell can be spoken when the creature is within spell range. This allows magic resistance (if any) and a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the creature's real name is spoken as well, any magic resistance is ignored and the saving throw vs. spell suffers a penalty of -2. If the saving throw is successful, the prison gem shatters.
  The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the victim into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature's soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature's true name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger item when the gem is enchanted. A sympathy spell can also be
placed on the trigger item. As soon as the subject creature picks up or accepts the trigger item, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem, without the benefit of magic resistance or saving throw.
   The gem prison will hold the trapped entity indefinitely, or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, allowing the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane (which could mean a character trapped by an inhabitant of another plane when the character is not on the Prime Material Plane), it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.
   Before the actual casting of the trap the soul spell, the wizard must prepare the prison, a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit Die or level of experience possessed by the creature to be trapped (for example, it requires a gem of 10,000 gp value to trap a 10 Hit Die or 10th-level creature). If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the entrapment is attempted. (Note that while characters have no concept of level as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that this value can change over time as characters advance.) Creating the prison gem requires an enchant an item spell and the placement of a maze spell into the gem, thereby forming the prison to contain the life force."}</textarea>

"description":"  This awful spell brings into existence a short-lived sphere of annihilation (as described in Appendix 3 of the DMG). The sphere is a black ball of nothingness about 2 feet in diameter that instantly and utterly destroys any matter that comes into contact with it. The sphere appears anywhere in the spell's range and moves up to 15 feet per round as the wizard directs.If the wizard attempts to bring the sphere into contact with a living creature, the potential victim gains a saving throw vs. breath weapon to dodge aside, but a victim who is unaware of the sphere's appearance or unable to move is destroyed without a saving throw.
  Once conjured, the sphere of ultimate destruction may not move exactly as the caster wishes.The wizard has a 75% chance to control it,plus 1% per point of intelligence over 12 and 3% for each point over 15. In other words, a wizard with an intelligence of 18 would gain a +12%bonus to his chance to control the sphere.If the wizard fails to control the sphere in any given round, it automatically moves directly towards him at its maximum speed of 15 feet per round.Unlike the magical item, another wizard may not contest the caster's control of a sphere of ultimate destruction unless the second wizard possesses a talisman of the sphere.
  Should a gate spell be cast upon the sphere, there is a 50% chance that the sphere is destroyed, a 35% chance that nothing happens, and a 15%chance that a gap is torn in the spatial fabric, catapulting everything in a 180-foot radius to another plane of existence. If the sphere is touched by a rod of cancellation, a tremendous explosion inflicts 3d4*10 point of damage to every thing within 60 feet as the two forces negate each other. No other spell or magical item has any effect on a sphere of ultimate destruction.
  There is a 5%chance that any particular manifestation of this spell does not cause a victim's utter destruction but instead transports him to a random plane of existence. The conjuring wizard has no way of knowing whether he has destroyed his enemy or merely blasted him into some remote dimension. The material component of this spell is a dark crystal ball that has been on the ethereal plane and that can be comfortably held in two hands. "}</textarea>
