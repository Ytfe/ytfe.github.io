"description":"Upon casting this spell, the caster is able to detect snares, pits, deadfalls and similar hazards along a path 10 feet wide and 40 feet long. Such hazards include simple pits, deadfalls, snares of wilderness creatures (for example, trapdoor spiders, giant sundews, ant lions, etc.), and primitive traps constructed of natural materials (mantraps, missile trips, hunting snares, etc.). The spell is directional--the caster must face the desired direction to determine if a pit exists or a trap is laid in that direction. The caster experiences a feeling of danger from the direction of a detected hazard, which increases as the danger is approached. The caster learns the general nature of the danger (pit, snare, or deadfall) but not its exact operation, nor how to disarm it. Close examination, however, enables the caster to sense what intended actions might trigger it. The spell detects certain natural hazards--quicksand (snare), sinkholes (pit), or unsafe walls of natural rock (deadfall). Other hazards, such as a cavern that floods during rain, an unsafe construction, or a naturally poisonous plant, are not revealed. The spell does not detect magical traps (save those that operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring; see the 2nd-level spell trip and the 3rd-level spell snare), nor those that are mechanically complex, nor those that have been rendered safe or inactive.
The caster must have his holy symbol to complete the spell."}</textarea>

Note that the area must have brush and trees in it in order for this spell to take effect. Briars, bushes, creepers, lianas, roots, saplings, thistles, thorn, trees, vines, and weeds become so thick and overgrown in the area of effect as to form a barrier. The area of effect is a square 20 feet on a side per level of experience of the caster, in any square or rectangular shape that the caster decides upon at the time of the spellcasting. Thus, an 8th-level caster can affect a maximum area of a 160-foot x 160-foot square, a 320-foot x 80-foot rectangle, a 640-foot x 40-foot rectangle, a 1,280-foot x 20-foot rectangle, etc. The spell's effects persist in the area until it is cleared by labor, fire, or such magical means as a dispel magic spell.
The second use of the spell affects a one-mile square area. The DM secretly makes a saving throw (based on the caster's level) to see if the spell takes effect. If successful, the spell renders plants more vigorous, fruitful, and hardy, increasing yields by 20% to 50% ([1d4+1] x 10%), given a normal growing season. The spell does not prevent disaster in the form of floods, drought, fire, or insects, although even in these cases the plants survive better than expected. This effect lasts only for the life cycle of one season, the winter \"death\" marking the end of a life cycle even for the sturdiest of trees.

The ground-covering vegetation or roots and rootlets in the area becomes very hard and sharply pointed.

This penalty lasts for 24 hours, after which the character's normal movement rate is regained.
Without the use of a spell such as true seeing, similar magical aids, or some other special means of detection (such as detect traps or detect snares and pits), an area affected by spike growth is absolutely undetectable as such until a victim enters the area and suffers damage. Even then, the creature cannot determine the extent of the perilous area unless some means of magical detection is used.
The components for this spell are the priest's holy symbol and either seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point."}</textarea>

"description":"By means of this spell, the caster can change 1d4 sticks, plus one stick per experience level, into snakes; thus, a 9th-level priest can change 10-13 sticks into an equal number of snakes. These snakes attack as commanded by the priest. There must, of course, be sticks or similar pieces of wood (such as torches, spears, etc.) to turn into snakes. Such a stick cannot be larger than a staff. Sticks held by creatures are allowed a saving throw equal to that of the possessor (i.e., a spear held by an orc must roll the orc's saving throw vs. polymorph).

Thus, an 11th-level priest has a maximum 55% chance that any snake created by the spell is poisonous. The spell lasts for two rounds for each experience level of the spellcaster.
The material components of the spell are a small piece of bark and several snake scales.
The reverse spell changes normal-sized snakes to sticks for the same duration, or it negates the sticks to snakes spell according to the level of the priest countering the spell (for example, a 10th-level priest casting the reverse spell can turn 11-14 snakes back into sticks)."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell enables the caster to charm a healthy oak tree (or other type if the DM allows) to cause it to serve as a protector. The spell can be cast on a single tree at a time.
While a liveoak spell cast by a particular caster is in effect, he cannot cast another such spell. The tree upon which the spell is cast must be within 10 feet of the caster's dwelling place, within a place sacred to the caster, or within 100 yards of something that the caster wishes to guard or protect.
The liveoak spell can be cast upon a healthy tree of small, medium, or large size, according to desire and availability. A triggering phrase of up to maximum of one word per level of the spellcaster is then placed upon the targeted oak. For instance, \"Attack any persons who come near without first saying sacred mistletoe\" is an 11-word trigger phrase that could be used by a caster of 11th level or higher casting the spell. The liveoak spell triggers the tree into animating as a treant of equivalent size, an Armor Class of 0 and with two attacks per round, but with only a 30-feet-per-round movement rate.
Tree Size Height Hit Dice Damage per Attack Small 12' - 14' 7-8 2d8 Medium 16' - 19' 9-10 3d6 Large 20' - 23'+ 11-12 4d6 A tree enchanted by this spell radiates a magical aura (if checked for), and can be returned to normal by a successful casting of a dispel magic spell, or upon the desire of the caster who enchanted it. If dispelled, the tree takes root immediately. If released by the caster, it tries to return to its original location before taking root. Damage to the tree can be healed with a plant growth spell, which restores 3d4 points of damage. A plant growth spell used in this fashion does not increase the size or hit points of the liveoak beyond the original value.
The caster needs his holy symbol to cast this spell."}</textarea>

"description":"The wall of thorns spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a person's finger. Any creature breaking through (or crashing into) the wall of thorns suffers 8 points of damage, plus an additional amount of damage equal to the creature's AC. Negative ACs subtract from the base 8 points of damage, but no adjustment is made for Dexterity. Any creature within the area of effect of the spell when it is cast, crashes into the wall of thorns and must break through to move. The damage is based on each 10-foot thickness of the barrier.
If the wall of thorns is chopped at, it takes at least four turns to cut a path through a 10- foot thickness. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fires burn away the barrier in two turns, creating a wall of fire effect while doing so (see wall of fire spell). In this case, the cool side of the wall is that closest to the caster of the thorn wall.
The nearest edge of the wall of thorns appears up to 80 yards distant from the caster, as he desires. The spell's duration is one turn for each level of experience of the caster, and it covers one 10-foot cube per level of the caster in whatever shape the caster desires.
Thus a 14th-level caster could create a wall of thorns up to 70 feet long by 20 feet high (or deep) by 10 feet deep (or high), a 10-foot-high by 10-foot-wide by 140-foot-long wall to block a dungeon passage, or any other sort of shape that suited his needs. The caster can also create a wall of 5-foot thickness, which inflicts half damage but can be doubled in one of the other dimensions.

				<div class="description-content">The wall of thorns spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a person&#039;s finger. Any creature breaking through (or crashing into) the wall of thorns suffers 8 points of damage, plus an additional amount of damage equal to the creature&#039;s AC. Negative ACs subtract from the base 8 points of damage, but no adjustment is made for Dexterity. Any creature within the area of effect of the spell when it is cast, crashes into the wall of thorns and must break through to move. The damage is based on each 10-foot thickness of the barrier.<br />If the wall of thorns is chopped at, it takes at least four turns to cut a path through a 10- foot thickness. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fires burn away the barrier in two turns, creating a wall of fire effect while doing so (see wall of fire spell). In this case, the cool side of the wall is that closest to the caster of the thorn wall.<br />The nearest edge of the wall of thorns appears up to 80 yards distant from the caster, as he desires. The spell&#039;s duration is one turn for each level of experience of the caster, and it covers one 10-foot cube per level of the caster in whatever shape the caster desires.<br />Thus a 14th-level caster could create a wall of thorns up to 70 feet long by 20 feet high (or deep) by 10 feet deep (or high), a 10-foot-high by 10-foot-wide by 140-foot-long wall to block a dungeon passage, or any other sort of shape that suited his needs. The caster can also create a wall of 5-foot thickness, which inflicts half damage but can be doubled in one of the other dimensions. Note that those with the ability to pass through overgrown areas are not hindered by this barrier. The caster can dismiss the barrier on command.</div>

"description":"By means of this spell, the caster is able to change a specially prepared staff into a treantlike creature of the largest size, about 24 feet tall. When the priest plants the end of the staff in the ground and speaks a special command and invocation, the staff turns into a treantlike creature with 12 Hit Dice, 40 hit points, and Armor Class 0. It attacks twice per round, inflicting 4d6 points of damage with every successful attack. The staff-treant defends the caster and obeys any spoken commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control trees. The transformation lasts either for as many turns as the caster has experience levels, until the caster commands the staff to return to its true form, or until the staff is destroyed, whichever occurs first. If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 hit points or less, it crumbles to a sawdustlike powder and the staff is destroyed. Otherwise, the staff can be used again after 24 hours and the stafftreant is at full strength.
To cast a changestaff spell, the caster must have either his holy symbol or leaves (ash, oak, or yew) of the same sort as the staff.
The staff for the changestaff spell must be specially prepared. The staff must be a sound limb cut from an ash, oak, or yew tree struck by lightning no more than 24 hours before the limb is cut. The limb must then be cured by sun drying and special smoke for 28 days. Then it must be shaped, carved, and polished for another 28 days. The caster cannot adventure or engage in other strenuous activity during either of these periods. The finished staff, engraved with woodland scenes, is then rubbed with the juice of holly berries, and the end of it is thrust into the earth of the caster's grove while he casts a speak with plant spell, calling upon the staff to assist in time of need. The item is then charged with a magic that will last for many changes from staff to treant and back again."}</textarea>
