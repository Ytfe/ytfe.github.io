"description":"This spell affects any single person or mammal it is cast upon. The creature then regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman or humanoid of man size or smaller, including brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter is included, while an ogre is not.
The spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton, but any word or action of the caster is viewed in the most favorable way.
Thus, a charmed creature would not obey a suicide command, but might believe the caster if assured that the only chance to save the caster's life is for the creature to hold back an onrushing red dragon for \"just a minute or two\" and if the charmed creature's view of the situation suggests that this course of action still allows a reasonable chance of survival.
The subject's attitudes and priorities are changed with respect to the caster, but basic personality and alignment are not. A request that a victim make itself defenseless, give up a valued item, or even use a charge from a valued item (especially against former associates or allies) might allow an immediate saving throw to see if the charm is thrown off. Likewise, a charmed creature does not necessarily reveal everything it knows or draw maps of entire areas. Any request may be refused, if such refusal is in character and does not directly harm the caster. The victim's regard for the caster does not necessarily extend to the caster's friends or allies. The victim does not react well to the charmer's allies making suggestions such as, \"Ask him this question. . .,\" nor does the charmed creature put up with verbal or physical abuse from the charmer's associates, if this is out of character.
Note also that the spell does not empower the caster with linguistic capabilities beyond those he normally has. The duration of the spell is a function of the charmed creature's Intelligence, and it is tied to the saving throw. A successful saving throw breaks the spell.
This saving throw is checked on a periodic basis according to the creature's Intelligence, even if the caster has not overly strained the relationship.
Intelligence Score Period Between Checks 3 or less 3 months 4-6 2 months 7-9 1 month 10-12 3 weeks 13-14 2 weeks 15-16 1 week 17 3 days 18 2 days 19 or more 1 day If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed creature by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed creature, the charm is broken automatically.
If the subject of the charm person/charm mammal spell successfully rolls its saving throw vs. the spell, the effect is negated.
This spell, if used in conjunction with the animal friendship spell, can keep the animal near the caster's home base, if the caster must leave for an extended period."}</textarea>

The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman or humanoid of man size or smaller, including brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter is included, while an ogre is not.<br />The spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton, but any word or action of the caster is viewed in the most favorable way.<br />Thus, a charmed creature would not obey a suicide command, but might believe the caster if assured that the only chance to save the caster&#039;s life is for the creature to hold back an onrushing red dragon for &quot;just a minute or two&quot; and if the charmed creature&#039;s view of the situation suggests that this course of action still allows a reasonable chance of survival.<br />The subject&#039;s attitudes and priorities are changed with respect to the caster, but basic personality and alignment are not. A request that a victim make itself defenseless, give up a valued item, or even use a charge from a valued item (especially against former associates or allies) might allow an immediate saving throw to see if the charm is thrown off. Likewise, a charmed creature does not necessarily reveal everything it knows or draw maps of entire areas. Any request may be refused, if such refusal is in character and does not directly harm the caster. The victim&#039;s regard for the caster does not necessarily extend to the caster&#039;s friends or allies. The victim does not react well to the charmer&#039;s allies making suggestions such as, &quot;Ask him this question. . .,&quot; nor does the charmed creature put up with verbal or physical abuse from the charmer&#039;s associates, if this is out of character.<br />Note also that the spell does not empower the caster with linguistic capabilities beyond those he normally has. The duration of the spell is a function of the charmed creature&#039;s Intelligence, and it is tied to the saving throw. A successful saving throw breaks the spell.<br />This saving throw is checked on a periodic basis according to the creature&#039;s Intelligence, even if the caster has not overly strained the relationship.<br />Intelligence Score Period Between Checks 3 or less 3 months 4-6 2 months 7-9 1 month 10-12 3 weeks 13-14 2 weeks 15-16 1 week 17 3 days 18 2 days 19 or more 1 day If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed creature by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed creature, the charm is broken automatically.<br />If the subject of the charm person/charm mammal spell successfully rolls its saving throw vs. the spell, the effect is negated.<br />This spell, if used in conjunction with the animal friendship spell, can keep the animal near the caster&#039;s home base, if the caster must leave for an extended period.</div>

"description":"When a priest casts this spell, he forces an animal to do his bidding. The creature is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell; if it fails, the caster may direct the creature with simple commands to act in any fashion desired. Sample commands include attack, run, fetch, etc. Suicidal or self-destructive commands grant the subject another saving throw to break free of the caster's control, with a +1 to +4 bonus depending on the extremity of the caster's orders. Ordering an animal to engage in combat is not necessarily self-destructive, as long as the prospective opponent is not more than three times the animal's Hit Dice or more than two size categories larger than the subject.

Control animal establishes a mental link between the caster and the subject, and the animal can be directed by silent mental command as long as it remains within range.
Because the caster's intelligence directs the animal, the creature may be able to take actions normally beyond its own comprehension, such as manipulating objects with its paws and mouth. The caster need not concentrate in order to maintain control of the creature unless he is trying to direct it to do something it normally couldn't.
Control animal only works on normal or giant-sized animals with Intelligence ratings between 1 and 4. Magical animals, monsters, and creatures of low Intelligence or higher are immune to the effects of this spell. Druids always avoid using this spell."}</textarea>

"description":"The summon insects spell attracts a cloud or swarm of normal insects to attack the foes of the caster. Flying insects appear 70% of the time, while crawling insects appear 30% of the time. The exact insects called are bees, biting flies, hornets, or wasps, if flying insects are indicated; biting ants or pinching beetles, if crawling insects are indicated. A cloud of the flying type, or a swarm of the crawling sort, appears after the spell is cast.
This gathers at a point chosen by the caster, within the spell's range, and attacks any single creature the caster points to.
The attacked creature sustains 2 points of damage if it does nothing but attempt to flee or fend off the insects during the time it is attacked; it suffers 4 points of damage per round otherwise. If the insects are ignored, the victim fights with a -2 penalty to his attack roll and a +2 penalty to his Armor Class. If he attempts to cast a spell, an initiative roll should be made for the insects to see if their damage occurs before the spell is cast. If it does, the victim's concentration is ruined and the spell is lost.
The insects disperse and the spell ends if the victim enters thick smoke or hot flames.
Besides being driven off by smoke or hot flames, the swarm might possibly be outrun, or evaded by plunging into a sufficient body of water. If evaded, the summoned insects can be sent against another opponent, but there will be at least a 1 round delay while they leave the former opponent and attack the new victim. Crawling insects can travel only about 10 feet per round (maximum speed over smooth ground) and flying insects travel 60 feet per round. The caster must concentrate to maintain the swarm; it dissipates if he moves or is disturbed.
It is possible, in underground situations, that the caster might summon 1d4 giant ants by means of the spell, but the possibility is only 30% unless giant ants are nearby. This spell does not function under water.
The materials needed for this spell are the caster's holy symbol, a flower petal, and a bit of mud or wet clay."}</textarea>

The caster must concentrate to maintain the swarm; it dissipates if he moves or is disturbed.<br />It is possible, in underground situations, that the caster might summon 1d4 giant ants by means of the spell, but the possibility is only 30% unless giant ants are nearby. This spell does not function under water.<br />The materials needed for this spell are the caster&#039;s holy symbol, a flower petal, and a bit of mud or wet clay.</div>

"description":"By means of this spell, the caster is able to summon certain woodland creatures to his location. Naturally, this spell works only outdoors, but not necessarily only in wooded areas. The caster begins the incantation and continues uninterrupted until some called creature appears or two turns have elapsed. (The verbalization and somatic gesturing are easy, so this is not particularly exhausting to the spellcaster.) Only one type of the following sorts of beings can be summoned by the spell. They come only if they are within the range of the call.
The caster can call three times, for a different type each time. Once a call is successful, no other type can be called without another casting of the spell. (The DM will consult his outdoor map or base the probability of any such creature being within spell range upon the nature of the area the caster is in at the time of spellcasting.) The creature(s) called by the spell are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell (with a -4 penalty) to avoid the summons. Any woodland beings answering the call are favorably disposed to the spellcaster and give whatever aid they are capable of. However, if the caller or members of the caller's party are of evil alignment, the creatures are entitled to another saving throw vs. spell (this time with a +4 bonus) when they come within 10 yards of the caster or another evil character with him. These beings immediately seek to escape if their saving throws are successful. In any event, if the caster requests that the summoned creatures engage in combat on his behalf, they are required to roll a loyalty reaction check based on the caster's Charisma and whatever dealings he has had with them.
This spell works with respect to neutral or good woodland creatures, as determined by the DM. Thus, the DM can freely add to or alter the list as he sees fit.
If the caster personally knows a certain individual woodland being, that being can be summoned at double the normal range. If this is done, no other woodland creatures are affected.
If a percentage chance is given in the accompanying table, druids and other naturebased priests add 1% per caster level. These chances can be used if no other campaign information on the area is available.
The material components of this spell are a pine cone and eight holly berries.

"description":"By means of this spell, the priest can turn one or more normal-sized insects into larger forms resembling the giant insects described in the Monstrous Manual. Only one type of insect can be altered at one time (i.e., a single casting cannot affect both an ant and a fly) and all insects affected must be grown to the same size. The number of insects and the size to which they can be grown depends upon the priest's level: Priest's Insect Maximum Level Hit Dice Total HD 7-9 3 9 10-12 4 12 13+ 6 15 For example, an 8th-level priest can grow three insects to 3 Hit Dice, four insects to 2 Hit Dice, or nine insects to 1 Hit Die. Flying insects of 3 Hit Dice or more can carry a rider of human size (assume that such can carry 80 pounds per Hit Die).
If the casting is interrupted for any reason, or if the insects are currently subject to any other magical effect (including this one), the insects die and the spell is ruined. The DM decides how many normal insects of what type are available; this is often a greater limitation on the spell than the limits above.
If the insect created by this spell matches an existing monster description, use the monster description. Otherwise, unless the DM creates a special description, the giant form has an Armor Class of between 8 and 4, one attack, and inflicts 1d4 points of damage per Hit Die.
For example, a 14th-level priest uses the giant insect spell to enlarge one beetle (all that is available) to 6 HD size. The DM decides the beetle has AC 5 and bites once for 6d4 points of damage.
Note that the spell works only on actual insects. Arachnids, crustaceans, and other types of small creatures are not affected. Any giant insects created by this spell do not attempt to harm the priest, but the priest's control of such creatures is limited to simple commands (\"attack,\" \"defend,\" \"guard,\" and so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex. Unless commanded to do otherwise, the giant insects attempt to attack whoever or whatever is near them.
The reverse of the spell, shrink insect, reduces any giant insect to normal insect size.
The number of Hit Dice affected by the priest is subtracted from the number of Hit Dice of the insects, and any insect reduced to 0 Hit Dice has been shrunk. Partial shrinking is ignored; an insect is either shrunk or unaffected. Thus, a 9th-level priest attacked by giant ants could shrink three warrior ants or four worker ants to normal insect size with no saving throw. This spell has no effect on intelligent insectlike creatures.
The priest must use his holy symbol for either version of the spell."}</textarea>

"description":"When this spell is cast by the priest, a horde of creeping, hopping, and flying insects gather and swarm in a thick cloud. In an environment free of normal insects, the spell fails. The insects obscure vision, limiting it to 10 feet. Spellcasting within the cloud is impossible. Creatures in the insect plague, regardless of Armor Class, sustain 1 point of damage for each round they remain within, due to the bites and stings of the insects.
Invisibility is no protection. All creatures with 2 or fewer Hit Dice will automatically move at their fastest possible speed in a random direction until they are more than 240 yards away from the insects. Creatures with fewer than 5 Hit Dice must check morale; failure means they run as described above.
Heavy smoke drives off insects within its bounds. Fire also drives insects away. For example, a wall of fire in a ring shape keeps a subsequently cast insect plague outside its confines, but a fireball spell simply clears insects from its blast area for one round. A single torch is ineffective against this vast horde of insects. Lightning, cold, or ice are likewise ineffective, while a strong wind that covers the entire plague area disperses the insects and ends the spell. The plague lasts two rounds for each level of the caster, and thereafter the insects disperse. The insects swarm in an area that centers around a summoning point determined by the spellcaster. The point can be up to 120 yards away from the priest. The insect plague does not move thereafter for as long as it lasts. Note that the spell can be countered by a dispel magic spell.
The material components of this spell are a few granules of sugar, some kernels of grain, and a smear of fat."}</textarea>

"description":"This potent spell summons a number of animals to the priest. For each level of the priest, a number of animals totaling 10 hit dice appear.
The Power who grants the spell enables the priest to know exactly what types and numbers of animals are within the area of effect. The priest may specify the numbers of animals he wants; for instance, a 16th-level priest could summon 60 HD of wolves, 40 HD of bears, and 60 HD of wolverines. The animals will begin arriving in one round and will be assembled at the priest's location at the end of three turns.
The animals will not fight among each other even if they are natural enemies.
Monsters (dragons, gorgons, hell hounds, etc.) cannot be summoned with this spell.
The summoned animals will aid the priest in any means of which they are capable.
They will enter battle, protect the priest and his companions, or perform a specified mission until the priest dismisses them or the spell expires. During this time, the priest can automatically communicate with his animals.
At the end of the spell, the animals instinctively return to their lairs. For the first three turns after the spell expires, the animals will not attack the caster, his companions, or other summoned animals. After this time, the animals will behave normally."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">This potent spell summons a number of animals to the priest. For each level of the priest, a number of animals totaling 10 hit dice appear.<br />The Power who grants the spell enables the priest to know exactly what types and numbers of animals are within the area of effect. The priest may specify the numbers of animals he wants; for instance, a 16th-level priest could summon 60 HD of wolves, 40 HD of bears, and 60 HD of wolverines. The animals will begin arriving in one round and will be assembled at the priest&#039;s location at the end of three turns.<br />The animals will not fight among each other even if they are natural enemies.<br />Monsters (dragons, gorgons, hell hounds, etc.) cannot be summoned with this spell.<br />The summoned animals will aid the priest in any means of which they are capable.<br />They will enter battle, protect the priest and his companions, or perform a specified mission until the priest dismisses them or the spell expires. During this time, the priest can automatically communicate with his animals.<br />At the end of the spell, the animals instinctively return to their lairs. For the first three turns after the spell expires, the animals will not attack the caster, his companions, or other summoned animals. After this time, the animals will behave normally.</div>

Wolf spirits' statistics are as follows: AC -4; MV 36 Fl 36 (B); HD 5+5; #AT 1; Dmg 3d6; AL N; SZ M; ML 20; THAC0 14. They are immune to all forms of mind control, illusions, gases, paralyzation, and spells which affect only corporeal creatures. They cannot be harmed by weapons of less than +2 enchantment.
Wolf spirits can be instructed to perform a service in the manner of the animal summoning spells. In this variation in the Animal and Summoning spheres, the spell does not expire until the spirits have performed their commanded service, to a maximum duration of 14 days. In the Guardian variation of this spell, the spirits can only be commanded to keep watch over an area or creature. The spell lasts 100 days for this type of service."}</textarea>
