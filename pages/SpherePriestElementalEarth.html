"description":"When this spell is cast, all natural, undressed earth or stone in the area of effect is softened. Wet earth becomes thick mud; dry earth becomes loose sand or dirt; and stone becomes soft clay, easily molded or chopped. The priest affects a 10-foot square area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the toughness or resilience of the ground at that spot (DM option). Magical or enchanted stone cannot be affected by this spell, nor can dressed or worked stone.
Creatures attempting to move through an area softened into mud are reduced to a move of 10 feet per round. Any creatures caught within the mud when the spell takes effect must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation or lose the ability to move, attack, or cast spells for 1d2 rounds as they flounder about in the muck. Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, and creatures are only reduced to half their normal movement rate, with no chance of being caught for a round or two. However, it is impossible to run, sprint, or charge over either surface.
Restore Strength Soften Earth and Stone Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before. For example, a party of PCs trying to break out of a cavern might use this spell to soften a wall.
While soften earth and stone does not affect dressed or worked stone, vertical surfaces such as cliff faces or cavern ceilings can be affected. Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face or roof and falls. A moderate amount of structural damage can be inflicted to man-made structures by softening the ground beneath a wall or tower, causing it to settle. However, most well-built structures will only be damaged by this spell, not destroyed. The material component is a bit of slip (wet clay) from the wheel of a master potter."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">By means of this spell, the priest transmutes his own cudgel, mace, or staff into an enchanted weapon of adamantite, the most magical mineral known. The adamantite mace gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls, but it can strike creatures normally hit only by +4 or better weapons. As an incarnation of elemental earth, the mace inflicts up to twice the damage (roll twice the required damage dice) against creatures of elemental air or magical avians such as griffons, perytons, pegasi, and winged baatezu or tanar&#039;ri. The adamantite mace retains its special properties for one round per level of experience of the caster.<br />The material component is a special powder made from a diamond worth 100 gp, sprinkled over the weapon.</div>

"description":"The spike stones spell causes rock to shape itself into long, sharp points that tend to blend into the background. It is effective on both natural rock and worked stone. The spike stones serve to impede progress through an area and to inflict damage. If an area is carefully observed, each observer is 25% likely to notice the sharp points of rock.
Otherwise, those entering the spell's area of effect suffer 1d4 points of damage per round.
The success of each attack is determined as if the caster of the spell were actually engaging in combat. Those entering the area are subject to attack immediately upon setting foot in the area and for each round spent in the area thereafter. The initial step enables the individual to become aware of some problem only if the initial attack succeeds; otherwise movement continues and the spike stones remain unnoticed until damage occurs. Charging or running victims suffer two attacks per round.
Those falling into pits affected by spike stones suffer six such attacks for every 10 feet fallen, each attack having a +2 bonus to the attack roll. In addition, the damage inflicted by each attack increases by +2 for every 10 feet fallen. Finally, the creatures also suffer normal falling damage.

Thus a 20thlevel priest casts an earthquake spell with a 100-foot-diameter area of effect.<br />Solidly built structures with foundations reaching down to bedrock sustain one-half damage; one-quarter damage if they score above 50% on a saving throw. An earth elemental opposed to the caster in the area of effect can negate 10% to 100% (roll 1d10, 0 = 100%) of the effect. Other magical protections and wards allowed by the DM may also reduce or negate this effect. If cast undersea, this spell may, at the discretion of the DM, create a tsunami or tidal wave.<br />The material components for this spell are a pinch of dirt, a piece of rock, and a lump of clay.<br />Earthquake Effects TERRAIN Cave or cavern--Collapses roof Cliffs--Crumble, causing landslide Ground--Cracks open, causing the following fractions of creatures to fall in and die: Size S: 1 in 4 Size M: 1 in 6 Size L: 1 in 8 Marsh--Drains water to form muddy, rough ground.<br />Tunnel--Caves in VEGETATION Small growth--No effect Trees--1 in 3 are uprooted and fall STRUCTURES All structures--Sustain 5d12 points of structural damage; those suffering full damage are thrown down in rubble CREATURES (See TERRAIN entry)</div>

"description":"This spell requires the priest to concentrate and cast the spell for the full duration of the spell. The casting time and duration are simultaneous; both activities occur in the same turn.
In the first round of casting, the priest summons an enormous black storm cloud over the area of effect. Lightning and crashing claps of thunder appear within the storm; creatures in the area of effect must make a saving throw or be deafened for 1d4 turns.
On the second round, acid rains down in the area, inflicting 1d4+1 points of damage.
No saving throw is allowed.
On the third round, the caster calls six lightning bolts down from the cloud. Each is directed at a target by the priest (all may be directed at a single target or they may be directed at six separate targets). Each lightning bolt strike causes 8d8 points of damage (a successful saving throw indicates half damage).
On the fourth round, hailstones rain down in the area, causing 3d10 points of damage (no saving throw).
On the fifth through tenth (and final) rounds, violent rain and wind gusts reduce visibility to five feet. Movement is reduced 75%. Missile fire and spellcasting from within the area of effect are impossible.
The sequence of effects ceases immediately if the priest is disrupted from spellcasting during the 1 turn duration of the spell. The priest may opt to cancel the effects at any time."}</textarea>
