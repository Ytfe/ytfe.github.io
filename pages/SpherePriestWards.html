"description":"The ethereal barrier is a defense against the passage of extradimensional creatures, including characters or monsters that are phased, ethereal, or travelling via dimension door or shadow walk. The priest creates an imperceptible barrier of 10 square feet per level that may be arranged in any fashion the priest desires. For example, a 3rd-level character can ward six 10-foot by 10-foot surfaces, which would be sufficient to guard a 10-foot by 10-foot by 10-foot room (four walls, a ceiling, and a floor need to be protected.) Note that some monsters may be capable of abandoning their ethereal approach in order to simply enter the barred area on their own feet-the ethereal barrier only bars their passage as long as they are traveling in the Border Ethereal. Also, while this spell can't be worn down by any form of attack, it does not bar teleportation, gates, or the passage of astral creatures.
Ethereal barrier may be cast as cooperative magic by several priests working together. As long as all involved characters can cast the spell, the areas of effect of each priest are added together. Total the levels of all priests involved and multiply by two to find the number of 10-foot by 10-foot squares that may be warded. For example, four 6th-level casters (24 total levels) can ward 48 10-foot by 10-foot squares. The duration is determined by the highest level priest involved, plus 1 turn for each additional priest. In the previous example, this would be 6 turns plus 3 turns for three additional priests for a total of 9 turns.
This spell is also suitable for focus magic (see the spell focus in the Tome of Magic). The material component is a special compound of rare earths and lead worth at least 10 gp per application. One application is required for each 10-foot by 10-foot square to be warded."}</textarea>

"description":"With this spell, the caster can enchant a chest, book, or any other nonliving object no larger than a 10'x10'x10' cube. When any creature other than the caster comes within three feet of the enchanted object, it instantly sprouts appendages and moves away from the creature as quickly as possible. The enchanted object continues to move until it is at least 10 feet away from the nearest creatures in the area.
After the enchanted object has moved a satisfactory distance from the nearest creature, the appendages disappear. When a creature again comes within three feet of the enchanted object, the enchanted object sprouts appendages and flees. This process continues until the enchantment is negated (through a dispel magic or similar spell) or the enchanted object is subdued or destroyed.
The enchanted object can sprout feet (MV 24), wings (Fl 24, maneuverability class B), or fins (Sw 24), whichever is most advantageous. Thus, a book on a shelf might sprout wings and fly away, while a table might gallop around a room. The enchanted object can freely and instantly trade appendages as necessary.
The enchanted object will move only through open spaces. It will not crash through windows, shatter a closed door, or dig through the earth. It cannot attack or take any actions other than movement. If surrounded or cornered, the enchanted object moves in random directions until it is restrained or destroyed.
The enchantment ends if the caster voluntarily negates it, if the enchanted object is destroyed (the object has the same vulnerabilities as it has in its normal state), or if the enchanted object is restrained for 2-5 (1d4+1) consecutive rounds. Restraint means that the object is prevented from fleeing; if a creature is able to grapple, lift, or sit on the object, it is considered restrained. A creature capable of lifting the object in its normal state is considered strong enough to restrain it (for instance, a person capable of lifting a 50-pound box is also capable of restraining such a box enchanted by frisky chest). The object may also be restrained by tossing a net or heavy blanket over it or by surrounding it with several characters.
The material components are a dried frog's leg, a feather, and a fish scale."}</textarea>

"description":"All invisible creatures who enter an area enchanted with invisibility purge instantly become visible. Invisibility -related spells do not take effect within the boundaries of the enchanted area, and magical devices such as potions of invisibility do not function.
Creatures with the natural ability to become invisible are unable to use this ability within the area of effect. Invisible objects carried into the warded area also become visible.
Invisible creatures or persons within the area of effect when invisibility purge is cast remain invisible; however, if such creatures exit the area of effect and later re-enter, they instantly become visible. Such creatures also lose any natural ability to turn invisible as long as they remain within the area of effect.
A creature who consumes a potion of invisibility outside the warded area becomes invisible normally, but becomes visible when he enters the area of effect; if the duration of the potion of invisibility has not yet expired when he exits the area of effect, he becomes invisible again outside the area.
Creatures who are invisible in their natural state or have no visible form (such as invisible stalkers) are not affected by this spell.
The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a silver mirror no more than three inches in diameter.
The invisibility purge can be cast as a cooperative magic spell. The potency of this spell can be increased if several priests cast it at the same time. The duration of the spell is then equal to one turn per level of the most powerful priest, plus one turn for every contributing priest. Each priest also increases the area of effect by one 10'x 10' square (these areas must be contiguous). Thus, a 9th-level priest and two 5th-level priests could create a 30'x 10' invisibility purge area having a duration of 11 turns."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">This spell creates a one-way invisible force field around the area of effect. The spell creates one 10&#039; x 10&#039; x 10&#039; cube for every level of the caster. These can be arranged into any rectangular shape the caster desires.<br />Intruders entering the protected area suffer no ill effects, but the barrier of retention prevents them from leaving. The spell affects all creatures who fail a saving throw vs.<br />spell. The caster can pass in and out of the barrier freely.<br />Intruders trapped by the barrier of retention can cast spells out of the barrier and can use spells such as teleport to escape the protected area. Objects cannot be hurled out of the barrier but can be carried out by an escaping creature. Dispel magic and similar spells negate the barrier.<br />The material component is a small cage made of silver wire. The caster must walk around the perimeter of the area of effect when casting.</div>

If the spell is activated again, six tentacles reappear; new tentacles are created to replace any destroyed previously. As long as one tentacle survives an encounter, the tentacles will continue to be replaced. Only when all six tentacles are destroyed is the spell permanently negated.<br />The material component is the dried tentacle of an octopus.</div>

"description":"This powerful spell affects all enemies of the spellcasting priest who enter the area of effect. The spell inflicts a -2 penalty on saving throws, a -1 penalty to armor class, and a - 1 penalty to attack and damage rolls. Creatures friendly to the cleric gain corresponding bonuses--+2 to saving throws, +1 to attack and damage rolls, and a bonus of 1 to AC.
Additional effects are possible, depending on the Power granting the spell; effects must correspond (or at least not conflict) with the spheres the priest normally uses. Multiple effects are possible.
The variation for the Sphere of Wards requires that each hostile creature entering the area of effect make a saving throw vs. spells with a -4 penalty or suffer 4d6 points of damage. An affected creature must then flee the area; it is unable to return. The creature must make a second saving throw vs. spell with a -4 penalty as it leaves the area or be blinded until magically cured.
The variation for the sphere of Law requires that a hostile creature make a saving throw every time it wishes to change an action. Thus, if a creature wishes to stop running and draw a weapon, a successful save is needed or the creature continues to run. Actions that cannot be continued (e.g., firing an arrow if the archer has no more arrows) are repeated as empty automatisms. In addition, creatures hostile to the priest automatically fail saving throws against Enchantment/Charm spells cast by the priest.
The variation for the Sphere of Chaos requires that hostile creatures make saving throws vs. spells at -4 or be affected by confusion (as per the spell). Affected creatures have a 5% chance per round of suddenly being attacked by a phantasmal killer.
All creatures who enter the area of effect are subject to the effects of the spell. All effects except blindness cease 3 rounds after an affected creature leaves the area.
Creatures reentering the area of effect must make new saving throws."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell creates a powerful set of protective wards that operate on a single fortified building, temple complex, tower, or similar structure. These wards protect the physical integrity of the structure and prevent magical access.
A building protected by preservation suffers only 25% of normal structural damage from sources such as siege engines, earthquakes (both natural and magical), and powerful weather-affecting spells. Spells which directly affect the physical integrity of the structure (e.g., passwall, stone shape, transmute rock to mud) simply fail when cast on the protected building.
Preservation creates a permanent protection from evil spell on the affected building.
Every surface of the building benefits from the effects of the spell.
Magical spells allowing access to the building fail. Thus, creatures attempting to teleport or fly into the building are stopped. Birds and creatures with natural flight may enter the building normally.
If the building is a temple (or other consecrated building) dedicated to the Power that granted the spell, all priests inside it gain the benefit of a sanctuary spell for the duration of the preservation.

"description":"The ward matrix spell links as many as six locations within the Prime Material plane.
Only locations that have a functioning Wards spell may be linked. Ward matrix conjoins the different Wards spells so that each linked site gains the protection of all other wards in the network.
From the place where the ward matrix is cast, magical connections spread to the other designated sites. These can be seen with a true seeing or similar spell as tendrils of magical energy running through the air just above ground level. The connections target their destinations and move toward them at a rate of 40 miles per turn. They can evade barriers such as anti-magic shells by moving above or around them. When the connections reach their destinations, they multiply and spread to connect all other locations in the network; this secondary linkage is established at a rate of 20 miles per turn.
The conjoining of Wards lasts for 60 days unless a linked area is destroyed or a Wards spell is dispelled. Any location that is destroyed or has its Wards spell dispelled is removed from the matrix; other connections remain intact for the duration."}</textarea>
