"description":"With this spell, the caster generates a squadron of tiny invisible servants who create a campsite for the caster and his companions. The caster indicates the desired area for the campsite (an area of 50-foot radius or less) and the number of persons the campsite is to accommodate (a number of persons equal to three times the level of the caster).
The servants clear the area of debris, set up tents and bedrolls, start a campfire, fetch water, and prepare a bland meal. The campsite is so skillfully prepared that it blends with the surrounding terrain, reducing the chance that the camp could be noticed by 50%.
Campfires, loud noises, and other activities can negate this.
The entire process takes 4-16 (4d4) rounds to complete.
The servants make camp with the gear and equipment provided for them; otherwise, the servants will improvise with materials available in the immediate area (50 yards of the designated campsite). For instance, if the party has no tents or beds, the servants will construct crude but comfortable beds of weeds and grass and temporary shelters of leaves and branches. If no materials are available, such as in the desert or similarly barren terrain, the servants will do their best to make the party as comfortable as possible within the environmental limitations.
The servants cannot fight for the party, deliver messages, or take any other actions other than creating the campsite.
The material components are a piece of string, a bit of wood, and a drop of water.
The reverse, break camp, causes the invisible servants to strike a campsite (an area of 50-foot radius or less). The servants extinguish fires, dispose of debris, and pack gear for a number of people equal to three times the level of the caster. The entire process takes 4- 16 (4d4) rounds to complete. When completed, all traces of the campsite are eliminated.

"description":"When a priest is trapped or otherwise endangered, this spell can summon help. The spell creates a hovering, ghostly image of a hand about one foot high. The caster can command it to locate a character or creature of the caster's choice based on a physical description. The caster can specify race, sex, and appearance, but not ambiguous factors such as level, alignment, or class.
After the hand receives its orders, it begins to search for the indicated creature, flying at a movement rate of 48. The hand can search within a 5-mile radius of the caster.
If the hand is unable to locate the indicated creature, it returns to the caster (provided he is still within the area of effect). The hand displays an outstretched palm, indicating that no such character or creature could be found. The hand then disappears.
If the hand locates the indicated subject, the hand beckons the subject to follow it. If the subject follows, the hand points in the direction of the caster, leading the subject in the most direct, feasible route. The hand hovers 10 feet in front of the subject, moving before him. Once the hand leads the subject to the caster, it disappears.
The subject is not compelled to follow the hand or help the caster. If the subject chooses not to follow the hand, the hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then disappears. If the spell expires while the subject is en route to the caster, the hand disappears; the subject will have to rely on his own devices to locate the caster.
If there is more than one subject within a 5-mile radius that meets the caster's description, the hand locates the closest creature. If that creature refuses to follow the hand, the hand will not seek out a second subject.
The ghostly hand has no physical form. The hand can be seen only by the caster and potential targets. It cannot engage in combat or execute any other task aside from locating the subject and leading him back to the caster. The hand will not pass through solid objects, but can pass through small cracks and slits.

"description":"This spell allows a caster to gain general knowledge of the customs, laws, and social etiquette of a tribe or village. The caster must be within 30 yards of a member of the tribe or village for the spell to have effect. The selected villager must possess the knowledge sought by the caster; for instance, he cannot be an infant, nor can he be mentally unstable or dead (although he can be asleep or unconscious).
The selected villager is allowed a saving throw; if he succeeds, the spell fails.
If the saving throw fails, the caster gains a general knowledge of the villager's local laws and customs, including those that apply to relevant tribal or clan types (such as customs observed by all giants). Typical information revealed by know customs includes common courtesies (outsiders must avert their eyes when addressing local officials), local restrictions (no animals or unaccompanied elves within the city limits), important festivals, and common passwords that are known by the majority of citizens (such as a phrase necessary to pass the guards at the main gate). Additionally, the spell gives the caster a +1 reaction adjustment to encounters with members of the relevant tribe or village.
Knowing the local laws and customs does not guarantee that the caster will conduct himself properly. Know customs is to be used as a guide; the DM is free to adjust the quality of information provided by a villager."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">This spell allows a caster to gain general knowledge of the customs, laws, and social etiquette of a tribe or village. The caster must be within 30 yards of a member of the tribe or village for the spell to have effect. The selected villager must possess the knowledge sought by the caster; for instance, he cannot be an infant, nor can he be mentally unstable or dead (although he can be asleep or unconscious).<br />The selected villager is allowed a saving throw; if he succeeds, the spell fails.<br />If the saving throw fails, the caster gains a general knowledge of the villager&#039;s local laws and customs, including those that apply to relevant tribal or clan types (such as customs observed by all giants). Typical information revealed by know customs includes common courtesies (outsiders must avert their eyes when addressing local officials), local restrictions (no animals or unaccompanied elves within the city limits), important festivals, and common passwords that are known by the majority of citizens (such as a phrase necessary to pass the guards at the main gate). Additionally, the spell gives the caster a +1 reaction adjustment to encounters with members of the relevant tribe or village.<br />Knowing the local laws and customs does not guarantee that the caster will conduct himself properly. Know customs is to be used as a guide; the DM is free to adjust the quality of information provided by a villager.</div>

"description":"This spell clears away weeds, stones, and other debris in a 10-foot-wide path extending 10 feet in front of the caster. The caster can create a continuous path for the duration of the spell, clearing a 10-foot-square ahead of him as long as he continues to move forward. The spell affects jungles, forests, rocky ground, and snow.
The result of the cleared path is that movement costs are reduced by half. This is reflected in a reduction of the penalty against movement in rough terrain. (See Table 74 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for terrain costs for movement.) For example, if clear path is used in heavy jungle, the movement cost is reduced from 8 to 4. In no case can clear path reduce movement cost below 1.
Clear path has no effect on rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water, nor does it affect quicksand, lava, or similar natural obstacles. It also has no effect on magically-created terrain or manmade barricades.
A priest using the clear path spell can be tracked easily. Tracking proficiency is not required.
The material components are a knife blade and a straw from a broom.
The reverse, clutter path, causes weeds, small stones, and similar debris to litter a 10- foot path extending 10 feet behind the caster. This hides a trail, making tracking more difficult. The caster can create a continuous path for the duration of the spell. The chance to successfully track on a cluttered path is reduced by 50%.
The material components are a handful of pebbles and a handful of weeds."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">By casting this spell, the priest transports himself and as many as 50 followers (who must join hands at the time of casting) to the Border Ethereal. Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw at a -4 penalty to avoid transportation.<br />The spell then allows the priest and his party to make as many as three round-trip journeys to and from the Inner Planes. It then allows them to return to the Prime Material plane.<br />Travel rates in the Ethereal plane are at four times normal speed. Travel times for locating or searching along curtains are all at the minimum time possible. Encounters with monsters occur at one-fifth the normal frequency. The priest and his party are not affected by the ether cyclone.<br />The spell expires when the priest and his party return to the Border Ethereal from an inner plane for the third time. They are then instantly transported to the Prime Material plane.</div>

"description":"The highway spell creates a shimmering plane of force that acts as a magical conveyor for the priest. By standing at the forward edge of the 10 x 100 yard plane, the priest and as many followers as can fit onto the square can travel as outlined below.
The highway travels 30 miles per hour (MV 88) over all terrains. The priest sets the height of the highway in a range from 1 foot to 100 yards above ground level. The highway moves as the priest wills; if the priest wishes to fix a destination in his mind, the highway will take the shortest route to that destination until the priest changes the course in his mind.
The highway cannot be used offensively. It will automatically travel over or around obstacles such as buildings and large creatures. It protects creatures traveling on it from adverse effects of the elements (ice, rain, gales, etc.). The highway can hover in place, but hovering can be achieved only at a height of 12 inches above ground level.
When the spell expires or the destination is reached, the highway gently lowers the priest and his party to the ground. The priest may order the highway to drop off creatures and collect others at intermediate destinations, although the priest who cast the spell must remain on the highway or it will disappear."}</textarea>
