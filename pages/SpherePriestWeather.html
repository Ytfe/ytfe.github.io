"description":"When a call lightning spell is cast, there must be a storm of some sort in the area--a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinn or air elemental of 7 Hit Dice or more). The caster is then able to call down bolts of lightning. The caster can call down one bolt per turn. The caster need not call a bolt of lightning immediately--other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed; however, the caster must remain stationary and concentrate for a full round each time a bolt is called. The spell has a duration of one turn per caster level. Each bolt causes 2d8 points of electrical damage, plus an additional 1d8 points for each of the caster's experience levels. Thus, a 4th-level caster calls down a 6d8 bolt (2d8+4d8).
The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whatever distance the spellcaster decides, up to 360 yards away. Any creature within a 10-foot radius of the path or the point where the lightning strikes suffers full damage unless a successful saving throw vs. spell is rolled, in which case only one-half damage is taken.

The spell can be used to ensure the comfort of the caster and those with him in extreme weather conditions.

"description":"Weather stasis maintains the weather conditions prevalent in the area of effect when the spell is cast. The spell affects a cube whose sides equal the caster's level times 10 feet (a 10th-level caster could affect a 100' x 100' x 100' cube).
An area protected by weather stasis is unaffected by temperature variations in the surrounding environment. The spell also acts as a shield against rain, snow, and hail, which cannot enter the protected area. If conditions of precipitation existed in the area of effect when the spell was cast, the identical weather will continue for the duration of the spell.
For example, weather stasis is cast in an area where the temperature is 75 F. and no precipitation is falling. Half an hour later, the temperature drops to 60 degrees and rain begins to fall. The protected area remains dry and the temperature stays at 75 degrees. If the spell had been cast while rain was falling in the area of effect, rain would continue to fall for the duration of the spell, even after it stopped raining in the surrounding area.
All physical objects other than rain, snow, and hail can pass into the protected area.
All creatures and characters can move freely into and out of the area. The spell does not prevent water-based spells or water-based creatures (such as water elementals) from operating in the area.
The spell protects against both natural and magically generated weather. Night and day pass normally in the protected area, although temperature variations associated with night and day do not occur.
The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a drop of rain."}</textarea>

"description":"By means of a control winds spell, the caster is able to alter wind force in the area of effect. For every three levels of experience, the caster can increase or decrease wind force by one level of strength. Wind strengths are as follows: Wind Force Miles Per Hour Light Breeze 2-7 Moderate Breeze 8-18 Strong Breeze 19-31 Gale 32-54 Storm 55-72 Hurricane 73-176 Winds in excess of 19 miles per hour drive small flying creatures--those eagle-sized and under--from the skies, severely affect missile accuracy, and make sailing difficult.
Winds in excess of 32 miles per hour drive even man-sized flying creatures from the skies and cause minor ship damage. Winds in excess of 55 miles per hour drive all flying creatures from the skies, uproot small trees, knock down wooden structures, tear off roofs, and endanger ships. Winds in excess of 73 miles per hour are of hurricane force.
An \"eye\" of 40-foot radius, in which the wind is calm, exists around the caster. Note that while the spell can be used underground, if the spell is cast in an area smaller than the area of effect, the eye shrinks 1 foot for every foot of confinement. For example, if the area of effect is a 360-foot area, the eye shrinks by 10 feet to a 30-foot radius; a space under 320 feet in a radius would eliminate the eye and subject the spellcaster to the effects of the wind. Once the spell is cast, the wind force increases or decreases by 3 miles per hour per round until the maximum or minimum speed is attained. The caster, with one round of complete concentration, can stabilize the wind at its current strength, or set it to increase or decrease. However, the rate of the change cannot be altered. The spell remains in force for one turn for each level of experience of the caster. When the spell is exhausted, the force of the wind wanes or waxes at the same rate, until it reaches the level it was at before the spell took effect. Another caster can use a control winds spell to counter the effects of a like spell up to the limits of his own ability."}</textarea>

"description":"To cast this spell, the priest must be in sight of a rainbow, or have a special component (see below). The rainbow spell has two applications, and the priest can choose the desired one at the time of casting. These applications are as follows: Bow: The spell creates a shimmering, multi-layered short composite bow of rainbow hues. It is light and easy to pull, so that any character can use it without penalty for nonproficiency.
It is magical: Each of its shimmering missiles is the equivalent of a +2 weapon, including attack and damage bonuses. Magic resistance can negate the effect of any missile fired from the bow. The bow fires seven missiles before disappearing. It can be fired up to four times per round. Each time a missile is fired, one hue leaves the bow, corresponding to the color of arrow that is released. Each color of arrow has the ability to cause double damage to certain creatures, as follows: Red --fire dwellers/users and fire elementals Orange --creatures or constructs of clay, sand, earth, stone or similar materials, and earth elementals Yellow --vegetable opponents (including fungus creatures, shambling mounds, treants, etc.) Green --aquatic creatures, electricity-using creatures, and air elementals Indigo --acid-using or poison-using creatures Violet --metallic or regenerating creatures When the bow is drawn, an arrow of the appropriate color magically appears, nocked and ready. If no color is requested, or a color that has already been used is asked for, then the next arrow (in the order of the spectrum) appears.
Bridge: The caster causes the rainbow to form a seven-hued bridge up to 3 feet wide per level of the caster. It must be at least 20 feet long and can be as long as 120 yards, according to the caster's desire. It lasts as long as the spell's duration or until ordered out of existence by the caster.
The components for this spell are the priest's holy symbol and a vial of holy water. If no rainbow is in the vicinity, the caster can substitute a diamond of not less than 1,000 gp value, specially prepared with bless and prayer spells while in sight of a rainbow. The holy water and diamond disappear when the spell is cast."}</textarea>

Within the area of effect, all creatures suffer 6d10 points of combined fire and electrical damage. A successful saving throw at a -4 penalty indicates half damage.
In addition, four large shooting stars materialize within the area of effect. The priest can individually target these at specific creatures. If creatures are not specified, the targets are randomly selected. Each shooting star causes 48 points of damage on impact (no saving throw is allowed). Any creature within 10 feet of impact suffers 24 points of fire damage (half-damage if a saving throw at -4 is successful)."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell requires the priest to concentrate and cast the spell for the full duration of the spell. The casting time and duration are simultaneous; both activities occur in the same turn.
In the first round of casting, the priest summons an enormous black storm cloud over the area of effect. Lightning and crashing claps of thunder appear within the storm; creatures in the area of effect must make a saving throw or be deafened for 1d4 turns.
On the second round, acid rains down in the area, inflicting 1d4+1 points of damage.
No saving throw is allowed.
On the third round, the caster calls six lightning bolts down from the cloud. Each is directed at a target by the priest (all may be directed at a single target or they may be directed at six separate targets). Each lightning bolt strike causes 8d8 points of damage (a successful saving throw indicates half damage).
On the fourth round, hailstones rain down in the area, causing 3d10 points of damage (no saving throw).
On the fifth through tenth (and final) rounds, violent rain and wind gusts reduce visibility to five feet. Movement is reduced 75%. Missile fire and spellcasting from within the area of effect are impossible.
The sequence of effects ceases immediately if the priest is disrupted from spellcasting during the 1 turn duration of the spell. The priest may opt to cancel the effects at any time."}</textarea>
