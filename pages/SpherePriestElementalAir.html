"description":"This spell enables a priest to conjure up a weak air elemental--a dust devil of AC 4, 2 HD, MV 180 feet per round, one attack for 1d4 points of damage--which can be hit by normal weapons. The dust devil appears as a small whirlwind 1 foot in diameter at its base, 5 feet tall, and 3 to 4 feet across at the top. It moves as directed by the priest, but dissipates if it is ever separated from the caster by more than 30 yards. Its winds are sufficient to put out torches, small campfires, exposed lanterns, and other small, open flames of nonmagical origin. The dust devil can hold a gas cloud or a creature in gaseous form at bay or push it away from the caster (though it cannot damage or disperse such a cloud). If skimming along the ground in an area of loose dust, sand, or ash, the dust devil picks up those particles and disperses them in a 10-foot-diameter cloud centered on itself.
The cloud obscures normal vision, and creatures caught within are blinded while inside and for one round after they emerge. A spellcaster caught in the dust devil or its cloud while casting must make a saving throw vs. spell to keep his concentration, or the spell is ruined. Any creature native to the Elemental Plane of Air--even another dust devil--can disperse a dust devil with a single hit."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell allows the priest to exert fine control over air currents and winds, possibly extinguishing small fires or manipulating light objects as he sees fit within the spell's range. Generally, the priest is limited to one discrete action per round since he must focus his wind servant tightly on any given task. The wind servant can affect objects or creatures weighing up to 1 pound per caster level, twice as much if the object is reasonably light or airy (a cloak, scroll, or haystack, for instance), or 10 times as much if the object is designed to be carried by the wind, such as a ship's sail or a bird in flight.
If an object is within the spell's weight limit, the caster may direct the wind servant to carry it along in gusts and air currents at a flying movement rate of 12 (E). If the object leaves the limits of the spell's range, the wind servant fails, and the object drops or falls normally from that point. Flying creatures of size M or smaller can be forced to land or be driven away by use of the spell if they fall within the weight limit, or slowed by 50% if they exceed the weight limit. Employing the wind servant against an arrow or light missile adds a penalty of -4 to the attack roll.
In dusty, snowy, or sandy regions, the caster can instead use wind servant to create a vicious zephyr of stinging dust around an enemy. This zephyr inflicts damage equal to the opponent's base AC less 2d6 points and creates a -2 penalty to the victim's attack rolls. For example, an enemy in leather armor +1 (AC 7) would suffer 7 - 2d6 damage if attacked by means of this spell. Note that any use of the wind servant requires the priest's undivided attention; he can take no other actions while directing the spell."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell provides a priest of elemental air with the ability to conjure a powerful column of wind that can bear his weight, permitting him to fly or glide for long distances.
If used from a high place such as a mountainside or tower, the caster can glide a maximum horizontal distance of 20 feet per foot of initial altitude-for example, if the priest used this spell and launched himself from a hilltop 800 feet high, he could glide a maximum distance of 16,000 feet, or about 3 miles.
If windborne is cast by a priest on level ground, the initial gust carries him aloft to a maximum altitude of 10 feet per caster level. From that point, he may then glide 10 feet per foot of initial altitude. For example, a 7th-level priest would ascend to an altitude of 70 feet and thus be able to glide for a total horizontal distance of 700 feet. He can choose to glide for a much shorter distance, but never less than his initial altitude.
While gliding, the priest moves at a rate of 15 (or about 450 feet) with a maneuverability class of D. Each round, he drops between 20 and 40 feet. He can choose to descend at a much more rapid pace, dropping up to 200 feet per round without risk of a damaging impact upon landing. The caster doesn't gain a mastery of aerial combat with this spell and suffers a -2 penalty to his attack rolls and Armor Class if he becomes involved in combat while gliding.
The material component for this spell is the feather from a giant eagle ."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell enables a creature, which can be as big as the largest giant, to tread upon air as if it were walking on solid ground. Moving upward is similar to walking up a hill. A maximum upward angle of 45 degrees is possible at one-half the creature's movement rate, as is a maximum downward angle of 45 degrees at the normal movement rate. An air-walking creature is in control of its movement, except when a strong wind is blowing.
In this case, the creature gains or loses 10 feet of movement for every 10 miles per hour of wind velocity. The creature can, at the DM's option, be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control of movement or suffering physical damage.
The spell can be placed upon a trained mount, so it can be ridden through the air. Of course, a mount not accustomed to such movement would certainly need careful and lengthy training, the details for which are up to the DM.
The material components for the spell are the priest's holy symbol and a bit of thistledown."}</textarea>

"description":"By means of a control winds spell, the caster is able to alter wind force in the area of effect. For every three levels of experience, the caster can increase or decrease wind force by one level of strength. Wind strengths are as follows: Wind Force Miles Per Hour Light Breeze 2-7 Moderate Breeze 8-18 Strong Breeze 19-31 Gale 32-54 Storm 55-72 Hurricane 73-176 Winds in excess of 19 miles per hour drive small flying creatures--those eagle-sized and under--from the skies, severely affect missile accuracy, and make sailing difficult.
Winds in excess of 32 miles per hour drive even man-sized flying creatures from the skies and cause minor ship damage. Winds in excess of 55 miles per hour drive all flying creatures from the skies, uproot small trees, knock down wooden structures, tear off roofs, and endanger ships. Winds in excess of 73 miles per hour are of hurricane force.
An \"eye\" of 40-foot radius, in which the wind is calm, exists around the caster. Note that while the spell can be used underground, if the spell is cast in an area smaller than the area of effect, the eye shrinks 1 foot for every foot of confinement. For example, if the area of effect is a 360-foot area, the eye shrinks by 10 feet to a 30-foot radius; a space under 320 feet in a radius would eliminate the eye and subject the spellcaster to the effects of the wind. Once the spell is cast, the wind force increases or decreases by 3 miles per hour per round until the maximum or minimum speed is attained. The caster, with one round of complete concentration, can stabilize the wind at its current strength, or set it to increase or decrease. However, the rate of the change cannot be altered. The spell remains in force for one turn for each level of experience of the caster. When the spell is exhausted, the force of the wind wanes or waxes at the same rate, until it reaches the level it was at before the spell took effect. Another caster can use a control winds spell to counter the effects of a like spell up to the limits of his own ability."}</textarea>

The caster may direct the cyclone to eject any carried creatures whenever he wishes, depositing the hapless souls wherever the whirlwind happens to be when they are released.
Maintaining the whirlwind requires the caster's full attention, and he cannot cast other spells or make any attacks while directing the spell's course. If his concentration fails for some reason, he cannot simply cancel the spell. Instead, the spell becomes uncontrolled as described above and dissipates after 1d3 rounds.
In truly desperate circumstances, priests of elemental air have been known to deliberately overrun their companions in order to carry them out of the path of some certain doom. Few care to repeat the experience. The material component for this spell is a handful of dust collected from a zephyr or snow from a williwaw."}</textarea>

The elementals remain for six turns from the time they first appear.<br />These elementals will obey the priest explicitly and cannot be turned against the caster. The priest does not need to concentrate to maintain control over the elementals.<br />They cannot be dismissed with spells such as dismissal; the elementals remain for the duration of the spell.</div>

"description":"This spell requires the priest to concentrate and cast the spell for the full duration of the spell. The casting time and duration are simultaneous; both activities occur in the same turn.
In the first round of casting, the priest summons an enormous black storm cloud over the area of effect. Lightning and crashing claps of thunder appear within the storm; creatures in the area of effect must make a saving throw or be deafened for 1d4 turns.
On the second round, acid rains down in the area, inflicting 1d4+1 points of damage.
No saving throw is allowed.
On the third round, the caster calls six lightning bolts down from the cloud. Each is directed at a target by the priest (all may be directed at a single target or they may be directed at six separate targets). Each lightning bolt strike causes 8d8 points of damage (a successful saving throw indicates half damage).
On the fourth round, hailstones rain down in the area, causing 3d10 points of damage (no saving throw).
On the fifth through tenth (and final) rounds, violent rain and wind gusts reduce visibility to five feet. Movement is reduced 75%. Missile fire and spellcasting from within the area of effect are impossible.
The sequence of effects ceases immediately if the priest is disrupted from spellcasting during the 1 turn duration of the spell. The priest may opt to cancel the effects at any time."}</textarea>
