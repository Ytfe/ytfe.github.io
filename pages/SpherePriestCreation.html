"description":"This spell causes a luminous glow within 20 feet of the spell's center. The area of light thus caused is equal in brightness to torchlight. Objects in darkness beyond this sphere can be seen, at best, as vague and shadowy shapes. The spell is centered on a point selected by the caster, and he must have a line of sight or unobstructed path to that point when the spell is cast. Light can spring from air, rock, metal, wood, or almost any similar substance. The effect is immobile unless it is specifically centered on a movable object or mobile creature. If this spell is cast upon a creature, any applicable magic resistance and saving throws must be rolled. Successful resistance negates the spell, while a successful saving throw indicates that the spell is centered immediately behind the creature, rather than upon the creature itself. A light spell centered on the visual organs of a creature blinds it, reducing its attack and saving throw rolls by 4 and worsening its Armor Class by 4. The caster can extinguish the light at any time by uttering a single word. Light spells are not cumulative--multiple castings do not provide a brighter light.
The spell is reversible, causing darkness in the same area and under the same conditions as the light spell, but with half the duration. Magical darkness is equal to that of an unlit interior room--pitch darkness. Any normal light source or magical light source of lesser intensity than full daylight does not function in magical darkness. A darkness spell cast directly against a light spell cancels both, and vice versa."}</textarea>

spell (a failed saving throw means the continual light is centered on the creature and moves as it moves).

If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed in a light-proof covering, the spell effects are blocked until the covering is removed.
Continual light brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) cancels the darkness so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. A direct casting of a continual light spell against a similar or weaker magical darkness cancels both.
This spell eventually consumes the material it is cast upon, but the process takes far longer than the time in a typical campaign. Extremely hard and expensive materials might last hundreds or even thousands of years.
The reverse spell, continual darkness, causes complete absence of light (pitch blackness), similar to the darkness spell but of greater duration and area."}</textarea>

"description":"The great circle is a powerful cooperative spell that can be used only by four or more priests, each casting the spell simultaneously. Because of the nature of this spell and its casting time, it is often used to cleanse grounds in preparation for the construction of a temple or sanctuary.
When casting the great circle, the priests stand in a circle of no more than 20-foot diameter. Each faces inward; when the spell is completed, each priest faces outward, directing the energy of the spell.
When the casting is complete, the spell takes the form of a radiant halo of golden light 20 feet above the ground. This halo quickly expands in a shimmering wave. It can pass through objects, with small arcs of the halo disappearing momentarily and reappearing on the far side. As the halo moves, it generates a high-pitched hum that varies in pitch, almost like a chorus. The halo moves slowly at first, but builds speed, reaching its maximum range at the end of one round.
The radius of the golden halo is dependent on the number of priests casting the spell.
Each priest adds 60 feet to the radius. Thus, four priests could generate a halo that extends 240 feet in all directions from the circle of priests. Theoretically, there is no limit to the number of priests who may contribute to this spell, but the need for the priests to be within a 20-foot diameter circle sets a practical limit of 20 casters.
The halo is pure energy tapped from the Positive Material plane. It causes harm to undead and evil beings within the area of effect. Undead creatures of 8 or fewer hit dice are instantly destroyed and are not allowed a saving throw to avoid the effect. More powerful undead suffer 1d8 points of damage per caster. A successful saving throw vs.
death magic reduces this damage to half. Creatures of evil alignment suffer 1d6 points of damage per caster (a saving throw is allowed for half-damage).
The reverse of this spell, the black circle, creates a ring of shimmering black energy.
Paladins and priests of good alignment suffer 1d10 points of damage per priest in the circle. All other good creatures suffer 1d4 points of damage per caster. Affected creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. death magic to reduce the damage to one-half."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">A siege wall uses magical energy to fortify all external areas of a fortified building, such as walls, battlements, drawbridges, and gates. External surfaces to be protected must be contiguous.<br />The protective effects of the siege wall are compatible with BATTLESYSTEM rules (see Chapter 7). Creatures assaulting the protected building have their movement rates reduced by half when trying to scale the exterior surfaces (scaling ladders, etc.).<br />Attackers suffer a -2 penalty to damage rolls for missile fire.<br />Damage or AD caused by war machines is reduced by 2 die levels (if normal damage is 1d12, 1d8 is rolled instead; if damage is 1d10, 1d6 is rolled; ballista has AD8).<br />Damage caused by crushing engines is rolled at -2 to the damage roll or ADs. Hits or hit points of crushing engines are reduced by half.<br />All enemies attacking a building protected by siege wall who enter an enclosed wall space are out of command unless they are in the line of sight of their commander, regardless of his control diameter.<br />All exterior areas of the fortification have their hit points or Hits doubled (see Hits of Building Features in BATTLESYSTEM rules).<br />The siege wall expires if the building is destroyed; it lasts a maximum of 24 hours.</div>
