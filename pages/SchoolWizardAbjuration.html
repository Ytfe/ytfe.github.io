"description":"This spell calls into being a disruptive magical lens that warps space around it. The barrier reaches from the top of the subject to the bottom, curves out by 10% of the height, and stands 3' in front of the target. All melee attacks made through the shield suffer -2 to hit, while missile attacks suffer -3 to hit. These penalties affect people on both sides of the shield. Because the light is bent, the lens produces a very visible effect, distorting and enlarging the subject of the spell to viewers on the other side of it.

To cast this spell, the wizard places a well made glass lens on the subject of the spell. This lens then vanishes to become the lens before the subject. When the spell expires, the glass lens reforms in midair before the creature, falling to the ground and possibly breaking. If this spell is cast on the caster themselves, they will know exactly when the spell is about to expire and can catch the lens before it falls.

The somatic components are minimal, only involving placing the lens on the subject, while the verbal components must be spoken at or above conversational tones."}</textarea>

All melee attacks made through the shield suffer -2 to hit, while missile attacks suffer -3 to hit. These penalties affect people on both sides of the shield. Because the light is bent, the lens produces a very visible effect, distorting and enlarging the subject of the spell to viewers on the other side of it.<br /><br />To cast this spell, the wizard places a well made glass lens on the subject of the spell. This lens then vanishes to become the lens before the subject. When the spell expires, the glass lens reforms in midair before the creature, falling to the ground and possibly breaking. If this spell is cast on the caster themselves, they will know exactly when the spell is about to expire and can catch the lens before it falls.<br /><br />The somatic components are minimal, only involving placing the lens on the subject, while the verbal components must be spoken at or above conversational tones.</div>

"description":"When this spell is cast, it creates a magical barrier around the recipient at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has three major effect:

First, all attacks made by evil creatures against the protected creature suffer -2 penalties to attack rolls; any saving throws caused by such attacks are made with +2bonuses.

Second, any attempt to possess or exercise mental control over the protected creature is blocked by this spell. Note that the protection does not prevent a vampire's charm itself, but it does prevent the exercise of mental control through the barrier. Likewise, a possessing life force is merely kept out. It would not be expelled if in place before the protection is cast.

Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by creatures of an extraplanar or conjured nature. This cause the natural weapon attacks require touching the protected being. Animals or monsters summoned or conjured by spells or similar magic are likewise hedged from the character.

This protection ends if the protected character makes a melee attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.

To complete this spell, the wizard must trace a 3-foot diameter circle on the floor with powdered silver.

This spell can be reversed to become  protection from good; the second and third benefits remain unchanged. The material component for the reverse is a circle of powdered iron.

"description":"When a wizard casts this spell, it has a chance to neutralize or negate magic it comes in contact with, as follows:

First, it removes spells and spell-like effects (including device effects and innate abilities) from creatures or objects.

Second, it disrupts the casting or use of these in the area of effect at the instant the dispel is cast. 

Third, it destroys magical potions (which are treated as 12th level for purposes of this spell). 

Each effect or potion in the spell's area is checked to determine if it is dispelled. The caster can always dispel his own magic; otherwise the chance to dispel depends on the difference in level between the magical effect and the caster. The base chance is 50% (11 or higher on 1d20 to dispel).

If the caster is higher level than the creator of the effect to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted from the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (thus making it more likely that the dispel succeeds); if the caster is of lower level, then the difference is added to the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (making it less likely that the dispel succeeds). A roll of 20 always succeeds and a roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher, only a roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dispelled.

A dispel magic spell does not affect a specially enchanted item, such as a magical scroll, ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous item, weapon, shield, or armor, unless it is cast directly upon the item. This renders the item nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An item possessed and carried by a creature gains the creature's saving throw against this effect, otherwise it is automatically rendered nonoperational. 

An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) rendered nonoperational would be temporarily closed. Note that an item's physical properties are unchanged: a nonoperational magical sword is still a sword.

Artifacts and relics are not subject to this spell; however, some of their spell-like effects may be, at the DMs option.
Note that this spell can be very effective when used upon charmed and similarly beguiled creatures. Certain spells or effects cannot be dispelled; these are listed in the spell descriptions."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell creates an ethereal magical hardened shell around a creature the caster points at in range while shouting the words to the spell. This shell exists 90% in the ethereal plane, only coming into the prime material plane in full when an object with enough kinetic energy to cause harm approaches it. The shell has HP equal to 5x the caster level and can block up to half of its remaining hp in damage to any single attack. 

Example: a 40hp shell could block a 10 damage attack, a 5 damage attack, and then a 8 damage attack (leaving it at 17 hp). If the next attack were to do 9 points of damage, the shell would be broken and the subject would take 1 point of damage (half of 17 rounded down is 8, so the 1 extra damage goes through to the target).

The shell only blocks kinetic attacks (including falling), so breath weapons, fire, acid, etc. are not obstructed. Furthermore, the shell is activated when attacks come within the area of the shell, so it will trigger on missed attacks that roll at least a modified 10, or on attacks that must past through the shell's space, e.g. missile attacks at creatures behind one with magic shell. 

Whenever subjected to an attack, the whole shield becomes visible as a spherical grid. The visibility of the shield decreases as its HP decreases. When finally broken, the shield visually fractures and shatters."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">This spell creates an ethereal magical hardened shell around a creature the caster points at in range while shouting the words to the spell. This shell exists 90% in the ethereal plane, only coming into the prime material plane in full when an object with enough kinetic energy to cause harm approaches it. The shell has HP equal to 5x the caster level and can block up to half of its remaining hp in damage to any single attack. <br /><br />Example: a 40hp shell could block a 10 damage attack, a 5 damage attack, and then a 8 damage attack (leaving it at 17 hp). If the next attack were to do 9 points of damage, the shell would be broken and the subject would take 1 point of damage (half of 17 rounded down is 8, so the 1 extra damage goes through to the target).<br /><br />The shell only blocks kinetic attacks (including falling), so breath weapons, fire, acid, etc. are not obstructed. Furthermore, the shell is activated when attacks come within the area of the shell, so it will trigger on missed attacks that roll at least a modified 10, or on attacks that must past through the shell&#039;s space, e.g. missile attacks at creatures behind one with magic shell. <br /><br />Whenever subjected to an attack, the whole shield becomes visible as a spherical grid. The visibility of the shield decreases as its HP decreases. When finally broken, the shield visually fractures and shatters.</div>

This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the protected wizard, spell effects delivered by touch, and spell effects from devices such as wands, staves, and so forth. Thus, a light spell cast to blind the protected wizard could be turned back upon and possibly blind the caster, while the same spell would be unaffected if cast to light an area in which the protected wizard were standing.

One to four (1d4) spell levels may be turned. The exact number is secretly rolled by the DM; the player never knows how effective the spell is.

Unlike the 7th level version of this spell, minor spell turning is not capable of partially turning a spell. For example, if a wizard has three levels of spell turning, he can turn three 1st-level spells, one 1st and one 2nd, or one 3rd-level spell. He can in no way turn spells of 4th level or above. If the caster is the target of a spell of a higher level than he is capable of turning, the caster receives the full brunt of the spell.

If the protected wizard and a spellcasting attacker both have spell turning effects operating, a resonating field is created that has the following effects. (See book for table).

"description":"When cast, a spectral sentry is summoned into being. The sentry is composed of a whitish misty vapor that resembles a watchful soldier clad in chain mail with a spear, sword, axe, or mace. The sentry is telepathically linked to the caster and will warn them (including a brief mental image) of any unusual activity within their range of sight. The wizard is woken, if asleep, up anytime the sentry reports back. The sentry has 18 perception and is never distracted, however it only warns of unusual activity. Any target that enters the area warded by the sentry (not just seen by the sentry) may be attacked at the wizard's discretion.

A spectral sentry cast in city street at night would begin to alert the wizard as people woke up and started walking around town, but as people moving through the streets become the norm, the sentry stops reporting them. A sentry placed in the woods would probably be reporting back to the wizard fairly often as wildlife moves through the area.

The sentry fights as a warrior equal to 1/2 the wizard's level (rounded down).

The sentry can be dispelled at will as long as the mental connection between the two is established."}</textarea>

The sentry is telepathically linked to the caster and will warn them (including a brief mental image) of any unusual activity within their range of sight. The wizard is woken, if asleep, up anytime the sentry reports back. The sentry has 18 perception and is never distracted, however it only warns of unusual activity. Any target that enters the area warded by the sentry (not just seen by the sentry) may be attacked at the wizard&#039;s discretion.<br /><br />A spectral sentry cast in city street at night would begin to alert the wizard as people woke up and started walking around town, but as people moving through the streets become the norm, the sentry stops reporting them. A sentry placed in the woods would probably be reporting back to the wizard fairly often as wildlife moves through the area.<br /><br />The sentry fights as a warrior equal to 1/2 the wizard&#039;s level (rounded down).<br /><br />The sentry can be dispelled at will as long as the mental connection between the two is established.</div>

This is cumulative with the saving throw bonus of a magical item, so a cloak of protection +4 could have a bonus of +7 to +10 on any item saving throws versus combustion effects. Remember that an item fails its saving throw on a natural roll of 1, regardless of any bonuses.

The item affected must be one discrete construction or object, although it can be articulated or composed of several parts (for example, a suit of armor, a catapult, a house, or a carriage).

A character dressed in a completely proofed article of clothing (a large cloak) gains a +2 bonus to saving throws vs. fire.

The material component for proofing versus combustion is a fire-brick made with the ashes left from a phoenix’s fire. Seafaring wizards often use this spell to protect their vessels from hostile fireballs and various fire-throwing devices."}</textarea>

"description":"A more potent form of the lesser sign of sealing, this spell allows the caster to guard an item or portal and prevent all other creatures from opening or passing through the sealed item or surface. The greater sign has several effects; first of all, it affects a doorway or item that opens (a chest, for instance) as a wizard lock spell. If placed in an open corridor or archway to prevent passage, the greater sign creates a magical barrier that repels all who try to pass.

Second, the greater sign greatly strengthens the physical structure of any door or item it is placed upon, granting a +6 bonus on any item saving throws and allowing the item or door to ignore 1 point of damage per caster level from any attack. For example, a greater sign cast by a 12th-level wizard would reduce the damage of any blow or spell by 12 points, so a fighter armed with a broad sword (maximum damage of 8 points) could never hack through a door protected by the sign.

Finally, if the protected doorway or item is forced open or destroyed by any means, the sign itself is not only destroyed, but also releases a spell upon the offending creature. The spell held by the sign is cast into the ward when the greater sign is created, and any spell the caster has memorized may be used in this way, from a fireball or shocking grasp to a very nasty wish or polymorph. The range of the sign's retributive spell is 10 yards per caster level, so it is possible to destroy the warding from a safe distance.

The sign is displayed in plain sight, and most wizards will recognize it for what it is. The caster cannot specify particular creatures or conditions for the sign’s operation; it functions against any creature that attempts to pass it, although the wizard can freely pass through his own sign without activating it. The greater sign can be removed by the caster, thus ending the spell, or it can be defeated by a limited wish or wish spell cast by a wizard of equal or higher level than the original caster; it cannot be dispelled.

The material component for a greater sign is a powdered diamond worth at least 1,000gp."}</textarea>

"description":"Otiluke's Freezing Sphere is a multipurpose spell of considerable power. If the caster opts, he may create any of the following:

A) Frigid globe. A small globe of matter at absolute zero temperature that spreads upon contact with water, or a liquid that is principally water, freezing it to a depth of 6 inches over an area equal to 100 square feet per level of the spellcaster. This ice lasts for one round per level of the caster.

The material component is a thin sheet of crystal about an inch square.

B) Cold ray. The spell can be used as a thin ray of cold that springs from the caster's hand to a distance of 10 yards per level of the wizard; this ray inflicts 1d4+2 points of damage per level of the caster upon the first creature struck. A saving throw vs. spell is applicable; all damage is negated if it is successful (as the ray is so narrow a save indicates it missed). If the first creature is missed, the path of the ray is plotted to its full distance, and anything else in its path must save (if applicable) or suffer appropriate damage.

The material component is a white sapphire of not less than 1,000gp value.

C) Globe of cold. This creates a small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, but not harmful. This globe can be hurled, either by hand to a distance of 40 yards (considered short range), or as a sling bullet. The globe shatters upon impact, inflicting 6d6 points of cold damage upon all creatures within a 10-foot radius (one-half damage if a saving throw vs. spell is successful). Use the Grenadelike Missile Table in the Dungeon Master Guide to find where misses strike. Note that if the globe is not thrown or slung within one round per level of the spellcaster, it shatters and causes cold damage as stated above. This timed effect can be employed against pursuers, although it can prove hazardous to the spellcaster and his associates as well.

"description":"A banishment spell enables the caster to force some extraplanar creature out of the caster's home plane. The effect is instantaneous, and the subject cannot come back without some special summoning or means of egress from its own plane to the one from which it was banished. Up to 2 Hit Dice or levels of creature per caster level can be banished.

The caster must both name the type of creature(s) to be sent away and give its name and title as well, if any. In any event, the creature's magic resistance must be overcome for the spell to be effective.

The material components of the spell are substances harmful, hateful, or opposed to the nature of the subject(s) of the spell.

For example, if iron, holy water, sunstone, and a sprig of rosemary were used in casting a banishment upon a being that hates those things, its saving throw versus the spell would be made with a -8 penalty (four substances times the factor of -2). Special items, such as hair from the tail of a ki-rin or couatl feathers, could also be added to change the factor to -3 or -4 per item. In contrast, a titan's hair or mistletoe blessed by a druid might lower the factor to -1 with respect to the same creature.

  Inside the pocket, the land is surrounded by air of a temperature matching that of the Prime Material plane at the moment the land was moved. In addition, a source of water is created within the pocket.
  Before the spell is cast, the area to be moved must be surrounded by solid markers of material from the destination plane.Thus,if a wizard wants to move his castle to the Elemental plane of Fire,he must first surround the area with solid blocks of matter from the elemental plane of Fire; such as hardened magma or magically crystallized fire.The blocks must be spaced no more than five feet apart and may be placed above ground or under surface(at a depth of no more than three fee).

nothing changed, with the exception of occasional visits from planar creatures.
  Any land that is moved in this manner can never again be moved with this spell.
  The material component (in addition to the markers) is the appropriate magical device to control elementals of the desired plane (bowl commanding water elementals, brazier commanding fire elementals, censer controlling air elementals, or stone controlling earth elementals). The item must be permanently placed at the heart of the area of effect and cannot be used for any other purpose. If the device is disturbed in any way, the spell immediately fails, allowing the energies of the elemental plane to flood into the protected area."}</textarea>

For every four levels of experience of the wizard, one creature can be protected by the Serten's spell immunity spell; however, if more than one is protected, the duration of the protection is divided among the protected

  For example, a 16th-level wizard can cast the spell upon one creature and it will last 16 turns, or place it upon two creatures for eight turns, or four creatures for four turns.) The protection gives a bonus to saving throws, according to spell type and level, as shown in  the following table.
  The material component of this spell is a diamond of at least 500 gp value, which must be crushed and sprinkled over the spell recipients. Each such creature must also have in its possession a diamond of at least one carat size, intact and carried on its person."}</textarea>

The victim remains there unless a reverse of the spell, with the creature's name and background, is cast. Magical
search by a crystal ball, a locate object spell, or similar means will not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned. The imprisonment spell functions only if the subject creature's name and background are known.
  The reverse spell, freedom, cast upon the spot at which a creature was entombed and sunk into the earth, causes it to reappear at that spot. If the caster does not perfectly intone the name and background of the creature to be freed, there is a 10% chance that 1 to 100 creatures will be freed from imprisonment at the same time.
  Note: The exact details of any creatures freed are up to the DM. A random method of determining this is to roll percentile dice twice (once for imprisoned creature density and once for a base number of creatures at maximum density). The rolls are multiplied and rounded to the nearest whole number. Each released creature has a 10% chance to be in
the area of the spellcaster. If monsters are being generated randomly, roll 1d20 for level, with rolls of 9+ considered 9, and the exact monsters determined by the random encounter tables.
  For example, if the initial rolls were 22 and 60, the number of monsters released is .22 x .60 = .1320 = 13 monsters. Since only 10% of these will be in the immediate vicinity of the caster, the wizard may encounter only one or two of them."}</textarea>
