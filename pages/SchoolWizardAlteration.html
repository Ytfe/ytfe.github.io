"description":"To cast this spell, the transmuter must wash themselves in soap and water, creating a plethora of bubbles which they then cover themselves with. The washing process is magical. Any normal soap will be extra sudsy, helping to facilitate the process.

When the wizard is done with washing, any area that retains bubbles is covered with a spell that increases one's perceived attractiveness. It should be noted that attractiveness is not the same as charisma, and this spell has no effect on one's charisma. For purposes of this spell, attractiveness is a non-standard stat based on a 3d6 roll, and this spell increases one's attractiveness to a minimum of 15, or by 1d4, whichever is higher. A character may not exceed 18 hotness.

Allure persists until the caster speaks or makes any verbal sound. The spell similarly fails if the bubbles are washed off, or if the caster falls asleep.  Should this spell be dispelled, the change is instant. All people viewing the subject see the transformation instantly. It is made even more apparent by the fact the caster is probably still covered in bubbles.

Someone making physical contact with an Allured section of the caster (i.e. an area covered by unseen magic bubbles) will feel the bubbles, breaking them, and breaking the spell. "}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">When a dancing lights spell is cast, the wizard creates, at his option, from one to four lights that resemble either torches or lanterns (and cast that amount of light), glowing spheres of light (such as evidenced by will-o-wisps), or one faintly glowing, vaguely man-like shape, somewhat similar to that of a creature from the elemental plane of Fire. The dancing lights move as the spellcaster desires, forward or back, straight or turning corners, without concentration upon such movement by the wizard.<br />The spell cannot be used to cause blindness (see 1st-level light spell), and it winks out if the range or duration is exceeded.<br />The material component of this spell is either a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm.</div>

"description":"This spell causes instant growth of a creature or object, increasing both size and weight. It can be cast only upon a single creature (or a symbiotic or community entity) or upon a single object that does not exceed ten cubic feet in volume per caster level. The object or creature must be seen to be affected.
 
It grows by up to 10% per level of experience of the wizard, increasing this amount in height, width, and weight. Magical properties are not increased by this spell - a huge sword +1 is still only +1, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions, a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate, etc. Weight, mass and strength are affected, though. Thus, a table blocking a door would be heavier and more effective, a hurled stein would have more mass (and cause more damage), chains would be more massive, doors thicker, a thin line turned to a sizeable, longer rope, and so on. A creature's hit points, Armor Class, and attack rolls do not change, but damage rolls increase proportionally with size. 

For example, a fighter at 160% normal size hits with his long sword and rolls a 6 for damage. The adjusted damage roll is 10 (that is 6 x 1.6 = 9.6, rounded up). Bonuses due to Strength, class, and magic are not altered.

The reverse spell, reduce, negates the enlarge spell or makes creatures or objects smaller. The creature or object loses 10% of its original size for every level of the caster, to a minimum of 10% of the original size. Thereafter, the size shrinks by one-foot increments to less than one foot, by one-inch increments to one inch, and by 1/10-inch increments to a minimum of 1/10 of an inch - the recipient cannot dwindle away to nothingness.

For example, a 16-foot-tall giant reduced by a 15th-level wizard (15 steps) would be reduced to 1.6 feet (in nine steps), then to 6/10 of a foot or 7.2 inches (in one step), and finally to 2.2 inches (in the last five steps). A shrinking object may damage weaker materials affixed to it, but an object will shrink only as long as the object itself is not damaged. Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell.

The material component of this spell is a pinch of powdered iron."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">Upon casting this spell, a feathery membrane grows under the wizards arms, extending along his sides all the way to his feet. The membrane appears to merge with the caster&#039;s skin and clothing.<br /><br />If the caster spreads his arms and jumps from a height, he may glide through the air. For each foot of elevation, the wizard can glide five feet horizontally. Thus, a wizard jumping from a 10-foot wall could glide up to 50 feet. Gliding characters have a movement rate of 12 and Maneuverability Class E.<br /><br />A wizard attempting to carry more than his normal weight allowance plummets to the earth upon takeoff.<br /><br />When the spell expires, the feathers instantly disappear. If the wizard is airborne, he immediately plummets toward the ground.<br /><br />The material component is an eagle&#039;s feather.</div>

During the course of the spell, the recipient cannot handle objects that weigh less than a dagger (one pound), for such objects stick to his hands and feet. 

Thus a wizard will find it virtually impossible to cast spells if under a spider climb spell. Sufficient force can pull the recipient free; the DM can assign a saving throw based on circumstances, the strength of the force, and so on. 

For example, a creature with a Strength of 12 might pull the subject free if the subject fails a saving throw vs. paralyzation (a moderately difficult saving throw). The caster can end the spell effect with a word.

A continual light brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. A direct casting of continual light against a similar or weaker magical darkness cancels both.

"description":"The fog cloud spell can be cast in one of two ways, at the caster's option: as a large, stationary bank of normal fog, or as a harmless fog that resembles the 5th-level wizard spell cloudkill.

As a fog bank, this spell creates a fog of any size and shape up to a maximum 20-foot cube per caster level. The fog obscures all sight, normal and infravision, beyond two feet.

As a cloudkill-like fog, this is a billowing mass of ghastly, yellowish-green vapors, measuring 40 feet x 20 feet x 20 feet. This moves away from the caster at 10 feet per round. The vapors are heavier than air and sink to the lowest level, even pouring down sinkholes and den openings. Very thick vegetation breaks up the fog after it has moved 20 feet into the vegetation.

The only effect of either version is to obscure vision. 

A strong breeze will disperse either effect in one round, while a moderate breeze will reduce the spell duration by 50%. 

The spell cannot be cast under water."}</textarea>

"description":"An irritation spell affects the epidermis of the subject creatures. Creatures with very thick or insensitive skins (such as buffalo, elephants, scaled creatures, etc.) are basically unaffected. There are two versions of the spell, either of which can be cast from the standard preparation:

Itching. When cast, this causes each subject to feel an instant itching sensation on some portion of its body. If one round is not immediately spent scratching the irritated area, the creature is so affected that the next three rounds are spent squirming and twisting, effectively worsening its Armor Class by 4 and its attack rolls by 2 during this time. Spell preparations are ruined in the first round this spell is in effect, but not in the following three rounds. Doing nothing but scratching the itch for a full round prevents the rest of the effect. If cast at one creature, the saving throw has a -3 penalty; if cast at two creatures, the saving throw has a -1 penalty; and if cast at three or four creatures, the saving throw is normal.

Rash. When a rash is cast, the subject notices nothing for 1d4 rounds, but thereafter its entire skin breaks out in red welts that itch. The rash persists until either a cure disease or dispel magic spell is cast upon it. It lowers Charisma by 1 point per day for each of four days (i.e., maximum Charisma loss is 4 points). After one week, Dexterity is lowered by 1 point also. Symptoms vanish immediately upon the removal of the rash, and all statistics return to normal. This can be cast at one creature only, with a saving throw penalty of -2.

The material component for this spell is a leaf from poison ivy, oak, or sumac."}</textarea>

"description":"The knock spell opens stuck, barred, locked, held, or wizard-locked doors. It opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains. 

If used to open a wizard-locked door, the spell does not remove the former spell, but simply suspends its functioning for one turn. In all other cases, it permanently opens locks or welds - although the former could be closed and locked again later. It does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. 

Note that the effect is limited by the area; a 3rd-level wizard can cast a knock spell on a door of 30 square feet or less (for example, a standard 4-ft. x 7-ft. door). 

Each spell can undo up to two means of preventing egress through a portal. Thus if a door is locked, barred, and held, or triple locked, opening it requires two knock spells. In all cases, the location of the door or item must be known - the spell cannot be used against a wall in hopes of discovering a secret door.

The reverse spell, lock, closes and locks a door or similar closure, provided there is a physical mechanism. It does not create a weld, but it locks physically operated locking mechanisms, set bars, and so on, up to two functions. It cannot affect a portcullis."}</textarea>

Horizontal movement is not empowered by this spell, but the recipient could push along the face of a cliff, for example, to move laterally.

Once cast, the spell requires no concentration, except when changing height. A levitating creature attempting to use a missile weapon finds himself increasingly unstable; the first attack has an attack roll penalty of -1, the second -2, and the third -3, etc., up to a maximum of -5.

The mouth cannot speak magical spells or use command words.

Of course, the magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, door, or any other object, excluding intelligent members of the animal or vegetable kingdoms. 

The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled, according to the command of the spellcaster. 

Some examples are to speak \"to the first creature that touches you,\" or \"to the first creature that passes within 30 feet.\" Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used, such as the following: \"Speak only when a venerable female human carrying a sack of groat clusters sits crosslegged within 1 foot.\" Such visual triggers can react to a character using the disguise ability. Command range is 5 yards per level of the wizard, so a 6th-level wizard can command the magic mouth to speak at a maximum encounter range of 30 yards (\"Speak when a winged creature comes within 30 yards.\"). 

The spell lasts until the speak command can be fulfilled; thus, the spell duration is variable. A magic mouth cannot distinguish invisible creatures, alignments, level, Hit Dice, or class, except by external garb. If desired, the effect can be keyed to a specific noise or spoken word.

				<div class="description-content">By using this spell, the wizard can create an invisible mark or rune on any surface. This mark remains invisible until conditions specified at the time of the casting are met. For example, the wizard could specify that the runes are only visible by the light of the moon or by the light of a moon of a certain phase (half, full, etc.), when viewed by an elf, at sunset or sunrise, when viewed by a wizard, when the caster is present, and so on. The spell cannot be used to transcribe magical runes, signs, glyphs, or symbols, but as many as seven letters or marks can be drawn. Unlike a magic mouth spell, a moon rune is permanent and will appear any time its conditions are met.<br /><br />In addition to appearing when the proper conditions are met, a moon rune also becomes visible if a detect magic, detect invisibility, true seeing, or other such spell or effect is used on it. A read magic spell will reveal the maker&#039;s words, if any. Moon rune cannot be cast on a living creature. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an erase spell.<br /><br />A moon rune requires a special mixture of pigment including mithril filings or powder worth at least 100gp.</div>

Creatures viewing this are blinded for 1d4+1 rounds unless they successfully save vs. spell. The fireworks fill a volume 10 times greater than that of the original fire source.

This spell can also cause a thick, writhing stream of smoke to arise from the source and form a choking cloud that lasts for one round per experience level of the caster. This covers a roughly spherical volume from the ground or floor up (or conforming to the shape of a confined area) that totally obscures vision beyond 2 feet. The smoke fills a volume 100 times that of the fire source. All within the cloud must roll successful saving throws vs. spell or suffer -2 penalties to all combat rolls and Armor Class.

The spell uses one fire source within a 20-foot cube, which is immediately extinguished. An extremely large fire used as a source might be only partially extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based creature (such as a fire elemental) used as a source suffers 1 point of damage per caster level."}</textarea>

The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time. 

Note that the rope trick spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space.

Note that the last two methods do not remove the wizard lock; they only negate it for a brief duration - about one turn. <br /><br />Creatures from other planes cannot burst a wizard lock as they can a held portal (see the hold portal spell).</div>

"description":"This spell functions as a Wizard Lock spell in all respects save that those designated by the wizard may be granted entrance or egress (independently of each other). Therefore, if Zula the Diviner casts this spell on his tower's entrance, he could name only himself as one to enter, but allow anyone to exit. Alternatively, when Maelie the Sorcerer casts this spell on house, he could name himself, Jada the Cleric of Bahamut, and Heather the Ranger as those that may enter, and the same people plus Bobby the Squire as those who may exit.

Specific people to be granted access must be known and named. The caster must have an accurate mental image of the person, they may not be known by rough description or a painting. Having met or scryed (with something like Clairvoyance) upon the person is accurate enough. Further discriminations similar to those found in the Magic Mouth spell can be made.

\"Myself and Goblin women weigh over 200lb, carrying a curved sword, and singing their national anthem in ogre may enter, anybody may exit\" would be a successful casting. \"Myself and those I slap in the face may enter, those that live in Westport may exit\" would fail (both the slapping and the living in Westport violate the conditions of the spell).

With this spell it is possible for a wizard to create conditions which they cannot fulfill, preventing themselves from opening the door.

The components of the spell are a lock and key made out of pure silver, costing no less than 200gp, which are consumed in the casting of the spell.

"description":"By means of this spell, the wizard causes his material form to \"blink\" directly from one point to another at a random time and in a random direction. This means that melee attacks against the wizard automatically miss if initiative indicates they fall after he has blinked.

Each round the spell is in effect, the wizard rolls 2d8 to determine the timing of the blink - the result of the dice roll is used as the wizards initiative for that round. The wizard disappears and instantaneously reappears 10 feet distant from his previous position. (Direction is determined by roll of ld8: 1 = right ahead, 2 = right, 3 = right behind, 4 = behind, 5 = left behind, 6 = left, 7 left ahead, 8 = ahead.) 

The caster cannot blink into a solid object; if such is indicated, reroll the direction. Movable objects of size and mass comparable to the caster are shoved aside when the caster blinks in. If blinking is impossible except into a fixed, solid object, the caster is then trapped on the Ethereal plane.

During each round that he blinks, the spellcaster can be attacked only by opponents who win initiative or by those who are able to strike both locations at once (e.g., with a breath weapon, fireball, or similar wide-area attack forms). Opponents with multiple attacks, or those operating under haste or similar effects, can often strike early enough to have at least one attack against the caster.

If the spellcaster holds off his attack (if any) until after the blink, the 2d8 delay until the blink is added to his normal ldl0 initiative roll (thus he probably attacks last in the round). Or the spellcaster can try to get his attack in before he blinks (he must announce his intent before rolling the 2d8 for blink timing and the 1d10 for initiative). In this case, the caster compares the two dice rolls, hoping that his initiative roll is lower than his blink roll (the two rolls are not added if he is trying to attack before he blinks). If so, he attacks according to his initiative roll, then blinks according to the blink roll. 

If his blink roll is lower than his initiative roll, however, he blinks out, then he attacks in whatever direction he's facing (he must go through with his attack, even if he is facing in the wrong direction to affect anyone).

				<div class="description-content">With this spell, the wizard empowers himself and others of his choosing with the ability to speak a secret language incomprehensible to others. Creatures designated to speak the language must be touching each other when the spell is cast.<br /><br />Once cast, the characters can choose to speak normally or in their secret tongue. They can speak and understand this mysterious language fluently.<br /><br />Fool&#039;s speech is not recognizable as any known languages, nor does it remotely sound like any language. A comprehend language or tongues will not translate it.

The force of this gust of wind (about 30 mph) is sufficient to extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames.

It forces back small flying creatures 1d6x10 yards and causes man-sized beings to be held motionless if attempting to move against its force.

A normal door takes ~10 minutes to properly seal with blubber.<br /><br />This spell creates a barrier around the door that prevents the passage of small creatures, objects, liquids, or gasses as long as the door is closed.

The explosive runes are difficult to detect - 5% chance per level of magic use experience of the reader; thieves have only a 5% chance. But trap detection by spell or magical device always finds these runes.

When read, the explosive runes detonate, delivering 6d4 + 6 points of damage to the reader, who gets no saving throw. A like amount, or half that if saving throws are made, is suffered by each creature within the blast radius. The wizard who cast the spell, as well as any he instructs, can read the protected writing without triggering the runes. Likewise, the wizard can remove the runes whenever desired. Others can remove them only with a successful dispel magic or erase spell. Explosive runes otherwise last until the spell is triggered.
 
The item upon which the runes are placed is destroyed when the explosion takes place, unless it is not normally subject to destruction by magical fire (see the Item Saving Throws in the Dungeon Master's Guide)."}</textarea>

But trap detection by spell or magical device always finds these runes.<br /><br />When read, the explosive runes detonate, delivering 6d4 + 6 points of damage to the reader, who gets no saving throw. A like amount, or half that if saving throws are made, is suffered by each creature within the blast radius. The wizard who cast the spell, as well as any he instructs, can read the protected writing without triggering the runes. Likewise, the wizard can remove the runes whenever desired. Others can remove them only with a successful dispel magic or erase spell. Explosive runes otherwise last until the spell is triggered.<br /> <br />The item upon which the runes are placed is destroyed when the explosion takes place, unless it is not normally subject to destruction by magical fire (see the Item Saving Throws in the Dungeon Master&#039;s Guide).</div>

"description":"By casting this spell, the wizard can empower a creature with superhuman strength. Unlike the 2nd-level strength spell, improved strength allows the recipient of the spell to ignore race or class restrictions on his maximum Strength score, possibly reaching scores as high as 25. The exact amount of strength gained varies by the recipient’s class group:

Class    Strength   Gain*
Warrior  1d8+4      (max 25)
Priest   1d6+4      (max 23)
Rogue    1d6+4      (max 23)
Wizard   1d4+4      (max 21)

* Count each percentile bracket of exceptional strength as one point; the strength gain proceeds as 18, 18/01, 18/51, 18/76, 18/91, 18/00, 19, and so on.

Even if the recipient is not a warrior, he gains all the benefits of an exceptional Strength category; for example, if a thief with a Strength of 14 gained 7 points, he would possess a Strength of 18/76 for the duration of the spell. In addition to the attack and damage bonus, increased chance to open doors or bend bars, and increased carrying capacity, the spell recipient may temporarily gain the ability to throw boulders as a giant of equivalent Strength, as shown below:

Strength Giant Type   Range     Damage
19       Hill giant   80 yards  1d6
20       Stone giant  100 yards 1d8
21       Frost giant  100 yards 1d8
22       Fire giant   120 yards 1d8
23       Cloud giant  140 yards 1d10
24       Storm giant  160 yards 1d12
25       Titan        200 yards 1d20

When the spell ends, the recipient is struck by intense exhaustion; he can do nothing except rest for 1d3 full turns to recover his strength. The material component is a strand of hair from a giant."}</textarea>

While the lodging is secure against winds of up to 70 miles per hour, it has no heating or cooling source (other than natural insulation qualities). Therefore it must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security otherwise, as it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition, resists flames and fire as if it were stone, and is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege machinery or giants).

The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being wizard locked and the latter being secured by a top grate of iron and a narrow flue. In addition, these three areas are protected by an alarm spell. Lastly, an unseen servant is called up to provide service to the spellcaster.

The inside of the shelter contains rude furnishings as desired by the spellcaster - up to eight bunks, a trestle table and benches, as many as four chairs or eight stools, and a writing desk.

The material components of this spell are a square chip of stone, crushed lime, a few grains of sand, a sprinkling of water, and several splinters of wood. These must be augmented by the components of the alarm and unseen servant spells if these benefits are to be included (string and silver wire and a small bell)."}</textarea>

The reverse - polymorphing a higher Intelligence creature into one of significantly lower Intelligence - results in a creature much more intelligent than appearances would lead one to believe. The polymorphed creature must succeed on a system shock (see Table 3) roll to see if it survives the change. After this, it must make a special Intelligence check to see if it retains its personality (see following).

The polymorphed creature acquires the and physical abilities of the creature it has been polymorphed into, while retaining its own mind. Form includes natural Armor Class (that due to skin toughness, but not due to quickness, magical nature, etc.), physical movement abilities (walking, swimming, flight with wings, but not plane shifting, blinking, teleporting, etc.), and attack routines (claw/claw/bite, swoop, rake, constriction, but not petrification, breath weapons, energy drain, etc.).

Hit points and saving throws do not change from the original form. Noncorporeal forms cannot be assumed. Natural shapeshifters (lycanthropes, doppelgangers, higher level druids, etc.) are affected for but one round, and can then resume their normal form.
If slain, the polymorphed creature reverts to its original form (it's still dead, though). (Note that most creatures generally prefer their own form and will not willingly stand the risk of being subjected to this spell!) As class and level are not attributes of form, abilities derived from either cannot be gained by this spell, nor can exact ability scores be specified.

When the polymorph occurs, the creature's equipment, if any, melds into the new form (in particularly challenging campaigns, the DM may allow protective devices, such as a ring of protection, to continue operating effectively). The creature retains its mental abilities, including spell use, assuming the new form allows completion of the proper verbal and somatic components and the material components are available. Creatures not used to a new form might be penalized at the DM's option (e.g., -2 to attack rolls) until they practice sufficiently to master it.

When the physical change occurs, there is a base 100% chance that the subjects personality and mentality change into that of new form (i.e., a roll of 20 or less on 1d20). For each 1 point of Intelligence of the subject, subtract 1 from the base chance on 1d20. Additionally, for every Hit Die of difference between the original form and the form it is assuming, add or subtract 1 (depending on whether polymorphed form has more Hit Dice [or levels) or fewer Hit Dice [or levels] than original, respectively). The chance for assumption of the personality and mentality of the new form is checked daily until the change takes place.

A subject acquiring the mentality of the new form has effectively become the creature whose form was assumed and comes under the control of the DM until recovered by a wish spell or similar magic. Once this final change takes place, the creature acquires the new form's full range of magical and special abilities.

Example: If a 1 Hit Die orc of 8 Intelligence is polymorphed into a white dragon with 6 Hit Dice, for example, it is 85% (20- 8 Intelligence + 5 levels difference [16-1]=17 out of 20= 85%) likely to actually become one in all respects, but in any case it has the dragon's physical and mental capabilities. If it does not assume the personality and mentality of a white dragon, it knows what it formerly knew as well.

The wizard can use a dispel magic spell to change the polymorphed creature back to its original form, and this requires a system shock roll. Those who have lost their individuality and are then converted back maintain the belief that they are actually the polymorphed creature and attempt to return to that form. Thus, the orc who comes to believe he is a white dragon, when converted back to his orc form, steadfastly maintains he is really a white dragon polymorphed into the shape of an orc. His companions will most likely consider him mad.

The material component of this spell is a caterpillar cocoon."}</textarea>

"description":"At the culmination of this spell, the caster hurls a pebble which grows and increases in speed, becoming a deadly boulder that inflicts 3d6 + 8 points of damage if it strikes the target. (The rules for boulders as missile weapons apply as described in the DMG) The caster's THACO is used to determine success, and the caster is considered to be proficient with the thrown pebble and receives no penalty for range. The maximum range of attack is equal to 50 feet plus 10 feet per level of the caster. Only the caster may throw the pebble.

The wizard can enchant one stone at 7th level and gains one stone per three levels of experience thereafter (two stones at 10th level, three at 13th level, etc.). Only one pebble may be thrown per round, and pebbles must be hurled in consecutive rounds. The spell has a duration in rounds equal to the number of pebbles enchanted. Each pebble requires a separate attack roll. Pebbles may be thrown at different targets within range.

The material components are pebbles, which revert to normal size when the spell expires.

The reverse of this spell ,turn boulder to pebble, shrinks a boulder to the size of a pebble. It affects only naturally occurring rocks and can not be used to shrink a statue or a cut gemstone.

The number of rocks that may be affected is equal to the number of experience levels of the caster. Boulders must not exceed one cubic foot per level of the caster. Thus, a 10th-level wizard could shrink 10 rocks, each of which is equal to or less than 10 cubic feet in size. All rocks are affected in the same round the spell is cast. Though they need not be touched, the boulders must be within 50 feet of the caster. Boulders that have been shrunk remain so until dispelled."}</textarea>

Each pebble requires a separate attack roll. Pebbles may be thrown at different targets within range.<br /><br />The material components are pebbles, which revert to normal size when the spell expires.<br /><br />The reverse of this spell ,turn boulder to pebble, shrinks a boulder to the size of a pebble. It affects only naturally occurring rocks and can not be used to shrink a statue or a cut gemstone.<br /><br />The number of rocks that may be affected is equal to the number of experience levels of the caster. Boulders must not exceed one cubic foot per level of the caster. Thus, a 10th-level wizard could shrink 10 rocks, each of which is equal to or less than 10 cubic feet in size. All rocks are affected in the same round the spell is cast. Though they need not be touched, the boulders must be within 50 feet of the caster. Boulders that have been shrunk remain so until dispelled.</div>

"description":"Naturally, this spell is an improvement of the 3rd-level alteration spell blink, allowing the wizard to shift his body to any point within 15 feet of his current location. Unlike the lower-level spell, improved blink allows the wizard to choose the exact time of his jump, the exact destination, and the orientation or facing of his choosing. For example, a wizard confronted by an enemy fighter could blink just before the fighter attacked, reappearing directly behind his foe for a back attack. If the wizard blinks away from an attack, his enemy automatically misses - but creatures with multiple attacks may be able to reposition themselves for another swing if the wizard blinks to a location within reach.

If the wizard intends to take any action such as attacking, casting a spell, or using a magical item, he must decide before the round begins if he will do so before or after he blinks. If he acts before he blinks, he may be endangered by an attack before he finishes; he can choose to proceed with his action, hoping that he won’t be hit, or he can abort his action by taking his blink for the round. On the other hand, if the wizard begins his action after his blink, the initiative modifier of his attack or spell is added to the time of his blink to determine when he attacks.

A blinking wizard dueling a fighter decides to blink first, when the fighter attacks and then lightning bolt the offensive fellow. The fighter rolls a modified 6 for initiative, so the wizard waits until 6, then blinks, making the fighter miss. At that time, he starts his lightning bolt, which has a casting time of 3-the spell will go off on 9.

In the Player’s Option: Combat & Tactics initiative system, the wizard must count 1, 2, or 3 phases from the time of his blink for fast, average, or slow actions. If the fighter above attacked in the average phase, the wizard would blink during the fighter’s attack, and then his lightning bolt (a fast spell) would go off 1 phase later, with any other slow actions.

Because the wizard can pick the location he is blinking to, he may not choose to blink into a movable object in order to force it aside - he must blink to an area clear of obstructions or obstacles. If he does attempt to blink into a movable object, he will find himself displaced to a random location (use the blink 1d8 rules in the PHB for determining where he ends up)."}</textarea>

On the other hand, if the wizard begins his action after his blink, the initiative modifier of his attack or spell is added to the time of his blink to determine when he attacks.<br /><br />A blinking wizard dueling a fighter decides to blink first, when the fighter attacks and then lightning bolt the offensive fellow. The fighter rolls a modified 6 for initiative, so the wizard waits until 6, then blinks, making the fighter miss. At that time, he starts his lightning bolt, which has a casting time of 3-the spell will go off on 9.<br /><br />In the Player&rsquo;s Option: Combat &amp; Tactics initiative system, the wizard must count 1, 2, or 3 phases from the time of his blink for fast, average, or slow actions. If the fighter above attacked in the average phase, the wizard would blink during the fighter&rsquo;s attack, and then his lightning bolt (a fast spell) would go off 1 phase later, with any other slow actions.<br /><br />Because the wizard can pick the location he is blinking to, he may not choose to blink into a movable object in order to force it aside - he must blink to an area clear of obstructions or obstacles. If he does attempt to blink into a movable object, he will find himself displaced to a random location (use the blink 1d8 rules in the PHB for determining where he ends up).</div>

"description":"By means of this spell, the wild mage is able to shape and direct the patterns of water currents, allowing him to mold liquids into a variety of forms. The spell affects a quantity of liquid no larger than the area of effect. If cast onto a larger body, such as an ocean or large lake, the spell affects only the water within the area of effect.

After casting waveform, the mage can form the water into any desired shape. The spell does not bind the liquid together in any fashion; it is still limited by its fluid properties and gravity. Thus, a mage could not use waveform to create a humanoid creature with arms and legs and direct it to walk across land. He could, however, create a roughly human shape with flowing arms that rises out of the water, crashes forward in a huge splash, then rises and repeats the process. Other possible shapes include gigantic waves, geysers, whirlpools, and troughs.

The shape takes one round to form, after which it can be maintained by concentration. The shape can be directed to move in any direction at the rate of 90 feet per round. If the waveform moves into or through a body of water, the form loses no intensity. However, if the wave is moved over dry ground, it loses one die of damage for every 10 feet crossed.

If propelled against a target, the waveform causes ld4 points of damage per level of the caster to creatures in its path. The waveform can be directed against creatures on the surface or underwater. Those struck are allowed a saving throw; success indicates half damage.

If the victims are in or on a body of water, the shape will sweep them along. Creatures of small size are carried with the form, moving at its speed. Medium and large size creatures are swept along at half the water's speed. Creatures larger than this resist the movement. Those caught in the current can make a Strength check each round to swim free of the current.

Boats and ships are particularly vulnerable to the waveform. If the waveform is twice the size of the vessel or more, the ship must make a seaworthiness check (as described in Table 77 of the DMG). Vessels passing the check suffer damage as described above, reducing seaworthiness ratings for future checks by 2d6 points until repairs are made.

Alternatively, this spell can be cast directly at a single water-based creature--a water weird, water elemental, or other creature from the elemental plane of water. In this case, the spell causes 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster. The effect is instantaneous and the spell ends immediately after the attack is made.

The material component is a small, carved oar decorated with aquamarines worth at least 500 gp. The oar disintegrates when the spell is cast."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">By means of this spell, the wild mage is able to shape and direct the patterns of water currents, allowing him to mold liquids into a variety of forms. The spell affects a quantity of liquid no larger than the area of effect. If cast onto a larger body, such as an ocean or large lake, the spell affects only the water within the area of effect.<br /><br />After casting waveform, the mage can form the water into any desired shape. The spell does not bind the liquid together in any fashion; it is still limited by its fluid properties and gravity. Thus, a mage could not use waveform to create a humanoid creature with arms and legs and direct it to walk across land. He could, however, create a roughly human shape with flowing arms that rises out of the water, crashes forward in a huge splash, then rises and repeats the process. Other possible shapes include gigantic waves, geysers, whirlpools, and troughs.<br /><br />The shape takes one round to form, after which it can be maintained by concentration. The shape can be directed to move in any direction at the rate of 90 feet per round. If the waveform moves into or through a body of water, the form loses no intensity. However, if the wave is moved over dry ground, it loses one die of damage for every 10 feet crossed.<br /><br />If propelled against a target, the waveform causes ld4 points of damage per level of the caster to creatures in its path. The waveform can be directed against creatures on the surface or underwater. Those struck are allowed a saving throw; success indicates half damage.<br /><br />If the victims are in or on a body of water, the shape will sweep them along. Creatures of small size are carried with the form, moving at its speed. Medium and large size creatures are swept along at half the water&#039;s speed. Creatures larger than this resist the movement. Those caught in the current can make a Strength check each round to swim free of the current.<br /><br />Boats and ships are particularly vulnerable to the waveform. If the waveform is twice the size of the vessel or more, the ship must make a seaworthiness check (as described in Table 77 of the DMG). Vessels passing the check suffer damage as described above, reducing seaworthiness ratings for future checks by 2d6 points until repairs are made.<br /><br />Alternatively, this spell can be cast directly at a single water-based creature--a water weird, water elemental, or other creature from the elemental plane of water. In this case, the spell causes 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster. The effect is instantaneous and the spell ends immediately after the attack is made.<br /><br />The material component is a small, carved oar decorated with aquamarines worth at least 500 gp. The oar disintegrates when the spell is cast.</div>

"description":"By employing a part water spell, the wizard is able to cause water or similar liquid to move apart, thus forming a 20-foot-wide trough. The depth and length of the trough are dependent upon the level of the wizard, and a trough 3 feet deep by 10 yards long is created per level. For example, at 12th level the wizard would part water 36 feet deep by 20 feet wide by 120 yards long.

				<div class="description-content">By employing a part water spell, the wizard is able to cause water or similar liquid to move apart, thus forming a 20-foot-wide trough. The depth and length of the trough are dependent upon the level of the wizard, and a trough 3 feet deep by 10 yards long is created per level. For example, at 12th level the wizard would part water 36 feet deep by 20 feet wide by 120 yards long. The trough remains as long as the spell lasts or until the wizard who cast it opts to end its effects. If cast under water, this spell creates an air cylinder of appropriate length and diameter.

The object affected can be no larger than a 10-feet cube, although a section of wall, floor, or ceiling about 10 square feet will work. Once magnetized, the object exerts a powerful attractive or repulsive force(caster's choice) against objects of ferrous metal. The effects vary by the proximity of the metal objects to the center of magnetism, as shown below .See book for table. 

The movement rate represent how fast objects are drawn to or repelled from the center of magnetism. If the creature or object in question is heavier than the magnetized item, the magnetized item does the moving instead. The effective strength is the pull of the magnetism at that range; the size equivalent refers to creature sizes, not weapons sizes. A character or creature carrying loose metal items or objects such as weapons, shields, helms, buttons, and so on must win opposed strength check  (see player option: combat& tactics for information on opposed ability checks) in order to keep his possessions from being wrenched out of his grasp by the magnetism. Securing a weapon in its sheath, holding an item with both hands, and other precautions may give the character a +2 to +4 to his base ability score, at the DM's discretion.

Characters wearing metal armor must attempt an opposed strength check to ignore the effects of the magnetism. If the character fails his strength check outright, he loses his footing and flies towards or away from the object at the full rate indicated. He suffers full falling damage based on the speed with which he hits the item- 1d6 for every 10 feet of the movement rate, or half that ground if the character passes his strength check but is beaten by the magnetism roll, he is moved one foot for each point he lost by. Again, some precautions or assistance may help iron wearing characters in their strength checks. For monsters, compare the creature's size to the effective size of magnetism.

An armored character who is stuck to a surface or object loses any dexterity adjustments to AC and cannot make any physical attacks. He can try to wriggle out of his armor and free himself, employ a magical item, or use psionic powers if he has any at his disposal.

The material component for this spell is a small bar magnet, bent into a u-shape and coated with mithril."}</textarea>

The caster is able to see normally within and outside the shield.<br /><br />The wildshield protects the caster from the effects of spells and magical items. The shield can completely absorb 2d6 spell levels (i.e., if the roll of 2d6 results in 10, the shield could absorb ten 1st-level spells, two 5th-level spells, or any similar combination), thereby negating their effects on the caster. Both area effect spells and those individually targeted at the wild mage can be absorbed. In the case of area spells, the wildshield protects only the mage. All others in the area of effect suffer normal effects from the spell.<br /><br />Wildshield also protects against wild surges, whether caused by the caster</div>

"description":"A duo-dimension spell causes the caster to have only two dimensions, height and width, with no depth. He is thus invisible when turned sideways. This invisibility can be detected only by means of a true seeing spell or similar methods. In addition, the duodimensional wizard can pass through the thinnest of spaces as long as these have the proper height--going through the space between a door and its frame is a simple matter. The wizard can perform all actions normally. He can turn and become invisible, move in this state, and appear again next round and cast a spell, disappearing on the following round.

Note that when turned, the wizard cannot be affected by any form of attack, but when visible, he is subject to double the amount of damage normal for an attack form; for example, a dagger thrust would inflict 2d4 points of damage if it struck a duodimensional wizard. Furthermore, the wizard has a portion of his existence in the Astral Plane when the spell is in effect, and he is subject to possible notice by creatures there. If noticed, it is 25% probable that the wizard is pulled entirely into the Astral Plane by any attack from an astral creature. Such an attack (and any subsequent attack received on the Astral Plane) inflicts normal damage.

The material components of this spell are a flat ivory likeness of the spellcaster (which must be of finest workmanship, gold filigreed, and enamelled and gem-studded at an average cost of 500 to 1,000gp) and a strip of parchment. As the spell is uttered, the parchment is given half a twist and joined at the ends. The figurine is then passed through the parchment loop, and both disappear forever."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell gives the wild mage the ability to seize magical energy directed at him and reshape it as he desires. While it is in effect, the spell gives no visible sign of its existence. It offers no protection against area effect spells.

If a wild mage is the target of a spell or magical item, this spell automatically allows him a saving throw. If the saving throw is failed, the opponent's spell has normal effects. If the saving throw is successful, the spell shape absorbs the magical energy of the opponent's spell. The wild mage can then choose to let the energy dissipate or he can instantly use it to cast a spell back at the opposing mage. The return spell must be of an equal or lesser spell level than the original one and must be currently memorized by the mage. The act of returning the spell does not cost the wild mage any of his memorized spells. Spell energy cannot be saved; if not used immediately, it dissipates.

For example, Hamos, a wild mage, is protected by a spell shape and is struck by a finger of death (a 7th-level spell). He succeeds at his saving throw and is now able to cast a spell of 7th level or lower. Hamos currently has feeblemind memorized. Since it is only a 5th-level spell, he chooses to cast it back at his enemy. He makes his level variation check (and doesn't get a wild surge) and the feeblemind is sent hurtling back at his foe. Hamos still has his original feeblemind memorized. The remaining two spell levels are lost, since they were not used in the same round.

If a wild mage is struck by two spells at once, he may choose which spell to shape. He suffers all effects of the remaining spell.
The material component is a diamond worth no less than 2,000 gp. When the spell is cast, the diamond is transformed into a lump of coal."}</textarea>

If the saving throw is failed, the opponent&#039;s spell has normal effects. If the saving throw is successful, the spell shape absorbs the magical energy of the opponent&#039;s spell. The wild mage can then choose to let the energy dissipate or he can instantly use it to cast a spell back at the opposing mage. The return spell must be of an equal or lesser spell level than the original one and must be currently memorized by the mage. The act of returning the spell does not cost the wild mage any of his memorized spells. Spell energy cannot be saved; if not used immediately, it dissipates.<br /><br />For example, Hamos, a wild mage, is protected by a spell shape and is struck by a finger of death (a 7th-level spell). He succeeds at his saving throw and is now able to cast a spell of 7th level or lower. Hamos currently has feeblemind memorized. Since it is only a 5th-level spell, he chooses to cast it back at his enemy. He makes his level variation check (and doesn&#039;t get a wild surge) and the feeblemind is sent hurtling back at his foe. Hamos still has his original feeblemind memorized. The remaining two spell levels are lost, since they were not used in the same round.<br /><br />If a wild mage is struck by two spells at once, he may choose which spell to shape. He suffers all effects of the remaining spell.<br />The material component is a diamond worth no less than 2,000 gp. When the spell is cast, the diamond is transformed into a lump of coal.</div>

"description":"When a statue spell is cast, the wizard or other creature is apparently turned to solid stone, along with any garments and equipment worn or carried. The initial transformation from flesh to stone requires one full round after the spell is cast.

During the transformation, there's an 18% chance that the targeted creature suffers a system shock failure and dies. The creature must roll percentile dice and add its Constitution score to the roll. If the total is 18 or less, the creature dies. If the total is 19 or more, the creature survives the transformation; the creature can withstand any inspection and appear to be a stone statue, although faint magic is detected from the stone if someone checks for it. Note that a creature with a Constitution of 18 or more will always survive the transformation.

Despite being in this condition, the petrified individual can see, hear, and smell normally. Feeling is limited to those sensations that can affect the granite-hard substance of the individual's body--i.e., chipping is equal to a slight wound, but breaking off one of the statue's arms is serious damage.

The individual under the magic of a statue spell can return to his normal state instantly, act, and then return to the statue state, if he so desires, as long as the spell duration is in effect.

The material components of this spell are lime, sand, and a drop of water stirred by an iron bar, such as a nail or spike."}</textarea>

This application of permanency can be dispelled only by a wizard of greater level than the spellcaster was when he cast the spell. Each casting of Greater Permanency reduces the wizard's constitution by 1 point. 

The personal spells upon which a permanency is known to be effective are as follows: comprehend languages, detect evil, detect invisibility, detect magic, infravision, protection from cantrips, protection from evil, protection from normal missiles, read magic, tongues, unseen servant. These spells may not be made permanent upon other creatures.

In addition to personal use, the permanency spell can be used to make the following object/creature or area-effect spells permanent: enlarge, fear, gust of wind, invisibility, magic mouth, prismatic sphere, stinking cloud, wall of fire, wall of force, web.

Additionally, the following spells can be cast upon objects or areas only and be rendered permanent: alarm, audible glamer, dancing lights, solid fog, wall of fire, distance distortion, teleport.

These applications to other spells allow it to be cast simultaneously with any of the latter when no living creature is the target, but the entire spell complex then can be dispelled normally, and thus negated. At the DM's option, permanency might become unstable or fail after a long period of at least 1,000 years. Unstable effects might operate intermittently or fail altogether.

The DM may allow other selected spells to be made permanent. Researching this possible application of a spell costs as much time and money as independently researching the selected spell. If the DM has already determined that the application is not possible, the research automatically fails.

  Iron body may create additional hazards for the wizard as the DM deems appropriate. For example,rust monsters are extremely dangerous to a wizard using this spell.Heat metal spells inflict double damage to the caster, And, naturally, the wizard sinks like a stone in water-although he could survive the crushing pressure and lack of air at the bottom of the ocean-at least until the spell expired.Some magical items, such as potions or winded instruments, may be temporarily unusable as well.
  The material component for this spell is a small piece of iron that once belonged to an iron golem.

"description":"  This spell changes one object or creature into another. When used as a polymorph other or stone to flesh spell, simply treat the spell as a more powerful version, with saving throws made with -4 penalties to the die roll. When it is cast in order to change other objects, the duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its enchanted state, as well as how different it is in size. The DM determines the changes by using the following guidelines:See book for table.
  A change in kingdom makes the spell work for hours (if removed by one kingdom) or turns (if removed by two). Other changes likewise affect spell duration. Thus, changing a lion to an androsphinx would be permanent, but turning a turnip to a purple worm would be a change with a duration measured in hours. Turning a tusk into an elephant would be
permanent, but turning a twig into a sword would be a change with a duration of several turns.
  All polymorphed objects radiate a strong magic, and if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon them, they return to their natural form. Note that a stone to flesh spell or its reverse will affect objects under this spell. As with other polymorph spells, damage sustained in the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed
creature.
  For example, it is possible to polymorph a creature into rock and grind it to dust, causing damage, perhaps even death. If the creature was changed to dust to start with, more creative methods to damage it would be needed; perhaps the wizard could use a gust of wind spell to scatter the dust far and wide. In general, damage occurs when the
new form is altered through physical force, although the DM will have to adjudicate many of these situations.
  The system shock roll must be applied to living creatures, as must the restrictions noted regarding the polymorph other and stone to flesh spells. Also note that a polymorph effect often detracts from an item's or creature's powers, but does not add new powers, except possibly movement capabilities not present in the old form. Thus, a vorpal sword polymorphed into a dagger would not retain vorpal capability. Likewise, valueless items cannot be made into permanent valuable items.
  The material components of this spell are mercury, gum arabic, and smoke."}</textarea>

"description":"  The magic of this spell causes metal, whether as soft as gold or as hard as adamantite, to turn to a crystalline substance as brittle and fragile as crystal.

Furthermore, this change is unalterable by any means short of a wish spell; a dispel magic will not reverse the spell.
  The caster must physically touch the item; if it is an opponent or something an opponent is using or wearing, the wizard must get into melee and make a successful attack roll. Any single metal item can be affected by the spell. Thus, a suit of armor worn by a creature can be changed to crystal, but the creature's shield would not be affected,
and vice versa. All items gain a saving throw equal to their magical bonus value or protection (the DM has this information). A +1/+3 sword would get a 10% (average of the two pluses) chance to save; +5 magical armor has a 25% chance to be unaffected; an iron golem has a 15% chance to save (for it is hit only by magical weapons of +3 or

"description":"With this spell, a wizard is able to assume the form of any living thing or creature below demigod status (greater or lesser deity, singular dragon type, or the like). The spellcaster becomes the creature he wishes, and has all of its abilities save those dependent upon Intelligence, innate magical abilities, and magic resistance, for the mind of the creature is that of the spellcaster. Thus, he can change into a griffon and fly away, then to an efreet and fly through a roaring flame, then to a titan to lift up a wagon, etc. These creatures have whatever hit points the wizard had at the time of the shape change. Each alteration in form requires only a second, and no system shock is incurred.
For example, a wizard is in combat and assumes the form of a will o' wisp. When this form is no longer useful, the wizard changes into a stone golem and walks away. When pursued, the golem-shape is changed to that of a flea, which hides on a horse until it can hop off and become a bush. If detected as the latter, the wizard can become a dragon, an ant, or just about anything he is familiar with.
A wizard adopting another form also adopts its vulnerabilities. For example, a wizard who becomes a spectre is powerless in daylight, and is subject to being turned, controlled, or destroyed by opposing clerics. Unlike similar spells, a wizard who is killed in another form does not revert to his original shape, which may disallow certain types of revivification.
The material component is a jade circlet worth no less than 5,000 gp, which shatters at the end of the spell's duration. In the meantime, the circlet is left in the wake of the shape change, and premature shattering ends the spell immediately."}</textarea>

"description":" Upon casting a time stop spell, the wizard causes the flow of time to stop for one round in the area of effect. Outside this area the sphere simply seems to shimmer for an instant.

The wizard can move and act freely within the area where time is stopped, but all other creatures, except for those of demigod and greater status or unique creatures, are frozen in their actions, for they are literally between ticks of the time clock. (The spell duration is subjective to the caster.) Nothing can enter the area of effect without being stopped in time also. If the wizard leaves the area, the spell is immediately negated. When the spell duration ceases, the wizard is again operating in normal time.
  Note: It is recommended that the DM use a stopwatch or silently count to time this spell.
