"description":"This spell allows a priest to sense how far a character, creature, object, or area is from a condition of balance -- in other words, the degree to which its alignment is removed from true Neutral. The spell gives no indication of the \"direction\" in which the alignment is removed from true Neutral except under certain conditions which follow. The spell does, however, indicate along which axis or axes of alignment the variation lies.

For example, a priest uses this spell to analyze the balance of a Chaotic Neutral creature. The spell indicates that the creature is removed from Neutral by one grade, and the variation is along the Law/Chaos axis; thus, the creature must be either Chaotic Neutral or Lawful Neutral. If the creature were Chaotic Evil, the spell would indicate that it is removed from balance by two grades, one along each axis; thus, the creature must be Chaotic Evil, Chaotic Good, Lawful Evil, or Lawful Good.

A priest has a 5% chance per level of correctly determining the direction of variation along one randomly chosen axis. This means that a 10th-level priest evaluating the balance of a Chaotic Neutral creature would have a 50% chance of learning that the creature is Chaotic (and hence Chaotic Neutral, since it is only one step away from balance).

Similar to spells such as detect evil, this spell will not yield a result on a hidden trap. If cast on a creature with an intelligence level of \"animal\" or \"non-,\" it will always read true Neutral (i.e., zero steps removed from balance).

The material components are four iron coins which the priest tosses in his hand while concentrating on the spell. The coins are not consumed in the casting."}</textarea>

While astral celerity is most often used in the astral plane, it also offers a small benefit to ethereal characters, too: their movement rates are increased by 50%, so a character with a movement rate of 12 would enjoy a movement rate of 18 while this spell was in effect.

Only creatures with Intelligence ratings of 1 to 4 (in other words, animal- or semi-intelligent creatures) can be affected by this spell.

The caster can affect any animals he wishes to within the spell's range, but all the subjects must be of the same species. The subject creatures are not allowed a saving throw unless they have magical powers, abilities, or are clearly not entirely natural; a priest could calm a normal bear, war dog, or wolf with little trouble, but it's more difficult to affect a winter wolf, hell hound, or owlbear.

Once roused, the spell's magic is broken and the animals are free to act in whatever fashion they normally would.

The caster can calm 2d4 Hit Dice of animals, plus 1 Hit Die per level, so a 4th-level priest could affect 2d4+4 Hit Dice of creatures. The caster can affect any animals he wishes to within the spell&#039;s range, but all the subjects must be of the same species. The subject creatures are not allowed a saving throw unless they have magical powers, abilities, or are clearly not entirely natural; a priest could calm a normal bear, war dog, or wolf with little trouble, but it&#039;s more difficult to affect a winter wolf, hell hound, or owlbear.<br /><br />While under the influence of this spell, the affected creatures remain where they are and do not attack or flee, unless they are attacked or confronted by a significant hazard such as a fire or a hungry predator. Once roused, the spell&#039;s magic is broken and the animals are free to act in whatever fashion they normally would. Note that creatures affected by this spell are not helpless and defend themselves normally if attacked.</div>

"description":"This spell allows the priest to perform an instantaneous reading of a single subject's emotional state. It can be used on any subject possessing Intelligence of 3 or better. This reading is neither deep nor specific and cannot pick out mixed emotions or intricate details. For example, it might tell the priest that the subject is fearful, but the spell cannot reveal what the subject is afraid of or why he is afraid.
Emotion read does not reveal individual thoughts or the subject's motivation. Thus, the spell might reveal that the subject is coldly unemotional at the moment, but not the fact that the subject is contemplating the cold-blooded murder of the priest.
Note that this reading is instantaneous. It reveals only the emotion that is strongest at the instant the spell is used. While this will usually be related to the subject's overall emotional state, it is always possible that the subject might be distracted for a moment or remember and respond to past events.
The subject is allowed a normal saving throw vs. spells to resist this spell. If the saving throw is successful, the priest receives no reading at all. If the subject's roll exceeds the necessary number by six or more, the priest perceives an emotion diametrically opposite to the subject's true emotion.

"description":"This spell causes a luminous glow within 20 feet of the spell's center. The area of light thus caused is equal in brightness to torchlight. Objects in darkness beyond this sphere can be seen, at best, as vague and shadowy shapes. The spell is centered on a point selected by the caster, and he must have a line of sight or unobstructed path to that point when the spell is cast. Light can spring from air, rock, metal, wood, or almost any similar substance. The effect is immobile unless it is specifically centered on a movable object or mobile creature. If this spell is cast upon a creature, any applicable magic resistance and saving throws must be rolled. Successful resistance negates the spell, while a successful saving throw indicates that the spell is centered immediately behind the creature, rather than upon the creature itself. A light spell centered on the visual organs of a creature blinds it, reducing its attack and saving throw rolls by 4 and worsening its Armor Class by 4. The caster can extinguish the light at any time by uttering a single word. Light spells are not cumulative--multiple castings do not provide a brighter light.
The spell is reversible, causing darkness in the same area and under the same conditions as the light spell, but with half the duration. Magical darkness is equal to that of an unlit interior room--pitch darkness. Any normal light source or magical light source of lesser intensity than full daylight does not function in magical darkness. A darkness spell cast directly against a light spell cancels both, and vice versa."}</textarea>

Light can spring from air, rock, metal, wood, or almost any similar substance. The effect is immobile unless it is specifically centered on a movable object or mobile creature. If this spell is cast upon a creature, any applicable magic resistance and saving throws must be rolled. Successful resistance negates the spell, while a successful saving throw indicates that the spell is centered immediately behind the creature, rather than upon the creature itself. A light spell centered on the visual organs of a creature blinds it, reducing its attack and saving throw rolls by 4 and worsening its Armor Class by 4. The caster can extinguish the light at any time by uttering a single word. Light spells are not cumulative--multiple castings do not provide a brighter light.<br />The spell is reversible, causing darkness in the same area and under the same conditions as the light spell, but with half the duration. Magical darkness is equal to that of an unlit interior room--pitch darkness. Any normal light source or magical light source of lesser intensity than full daylight does not function in magical darkness. A darkness spell cast directly against a light spell cancels both, and vice versa.</div>

The barrier moves with the recipient and has three major effects: First, all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures against the protected creature receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll, and any saving throws caused by such attacks are made by the protected creature with a +2 bonus.
Second, any attempt to exercise mental control over the protected creature (if, for example, it has been charmed by a vampire) or to invade and take over its mind (as by a ghost's magic jar attack) is blocked by this spell. Note that the protection does not prevent a vampire's charm itself, nor end it, but it does prevent the vampire from exercising mental control through the barrier. Likewise, an outside life force is merely kept out, and would not be expelled if in place before the protection was cast.
Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by creatures of an extraplanar or conjured nature (such as aerial servants, elementals, imps, invisible stalkers, salamanders, water weirds, xorn, and others). This causes the natural (body) weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creature to recoil if such attacks require touching the protected creature.
Animals or monsters summoned or conjured by spells or similar magic are likewise hedged from the character. This protection ends if the protected character makes a melee attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.
To complete this spell, the priest uses holy water or burning incense.
This spell can be reversed to become protection from good, with the second and third benefits remaining unchanged.
The material components for the reverse are a circle of unholy water or smoldering dung."}</textarea>

"description":"This is a cooperative magic spell. It requires a minimum of two priests and can accommodate a maximum of ten. Each priest must cast ring of hands on the same round.
At the end of the casting, the priests involved join hands, thus completing the spell. If any priest breaks the circle, the spell immediately ceases. The priests may not move from their locations but are free to speak. They may not cast spells requiring a somatic or material component while the ring is formed.
The ring of hands forms a protective barrier around the priests and everything within their circle. For each priest, assume a five-foot circumference of the circle; thus, three priests would create a circle of 15-foot circumference. For easy calculation, assume that for each priest, the circle can accommodate four persons.
The barrier functions as a protection from evil spell. Attacks by evil creatures suffer a -1 penalty for every priest forming the circle. Saving throws made by the priests or anyone in the circle against attacks from such creatures receive a +1 bonus for every priest in the circle.
Attempts at mental control over protected creatures are blocked. Extraplanar and conjured creatures are unable to touch the priests and those within the circle, although melee attacks against such creatures by those within the ring break the barrier.
Because the priests casting the spell cannot move and must hold hands, they do not receive any Dexterity bonuses to Armor Class. Furthermore, opponents gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against the priests, since there is little they can do to avoid a blow.
Creatures within the ring are free to act as they wish. Melee attacks by those within the ring are limited to piercing weapons and suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls since the priests intervene.
The reverse of this spell, ring of woe, functions as detailed above except the effect applies to good creatures as would a protection from good spell."}</textarea>

Melee attacks by those within the ring are limited to piercing weapons and suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls since the priests intervene.<br />The reverse of this spell, ring of woe, functions as detailed above except the effect applies to good creatures as would a protection from good spell.</div>

"description":"One of the more bizarre contentions held by priests of the School of Thought is generally scoffed at by outsiders. The theory states that once a thought has occurred in someone's brain, it exists as a \"freestanding mental object.\" This \"thought object\" usually remains inside the brain of the creature that created it, but sometimes it escapes (this supposedly explains why people forget things). When this happens, the thought object stays in the geographical area where it was lost. Any receptive brain (usually the brain of the creature that initially created the thought) can pick it up again simply by bumping into the invisible, free-floating thought. According to the theory, this is the reason that people can regain a lost thought by going back to the location where the thought was lost. This supposedly works because the free-floating thought is recaptured, not because the locale reminds them of the thought. Unfortunately for philosophers who disagree with this, thought capture seems to be extremely strong evidence for this theory.
This spell makes the priest's brain something of a magnet that attracts thought objects in close proximity. The priest can sense strong thoughts and emotions and can sometimes even see momentary visions of creatures who died or suffered some powerful emotion in the immediate vicinity. Thought objects are always attracted to the priest in the order of the strongest (those attached to powerful emotions or significant events) to the weakest.
Thus, if several thought objects share the same vicinity, the priest will perceive information about the most interesting or significant event. The priest might pick up images of a battle from the point of view of a warrior who died there, or he might gain information about the victor of the battle.
The DM dictates the information provided to the priest, and thus can use this spell to provide players with important background information or can add texture to a campaign world. The information provided might be highly cryptic or symbolic, perhaps in the form of a rhyme or riddle.
The priest gains one thought object per casting of the spell. The spell may be cast a number of times in the same locale, with the priest gaining a different thought object with each casting. A locale contains a finite number of thoughts, however, and once the priest has gained all of them (per the DM), the spell will fail in that locale."}</textarea>

"description":"The priest casting an augury spell seeks to divine whether an action in the immediate future (within one-half hour) will benefit or harm the party. For example, if a party is considering the destruction of a weird seal that closes a portal, an augury spell can be used to find if weal or woe will be the immediate result. If the spell is successful, the DM yields some indication of the probable outcome: \"weal,\" \"woe,\" or possibly a cryptic puzzle or rhyme. The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70%, plus 1% for each level of the priest casting the spell; for example, 71% at 1st level, 72% at 2nd, etc.
Your DM determines any adjustments for the particular conditions of each augury.
For example, if the question is \"Will we do well if we venture to the third level?\" and a terrible troll guarding 10,000 sp and a shield +1 lurks near the entrance to the level (which the DM estimates the party could beat after a hard fight), the augury might be: \"Great risk brings great reward.\" If the troll is too strong for the party, the augury might be: \"Woe and destruction await!\" Likewise, a party casting several auguries about the same action in quick succession might receive identical answers, regardless of the dice rolls.
The material component for an augury spell is a set of gem-inlaid sticks, dragon bones, or similar tokens of at least 1,000 gp value (which are not expended in casting)."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell affects any single person or mammal it is cast upon. The creature then regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman or humanoid of man size or smaller, including brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter is included, while an ogre is not.
The spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton, but any word or action of the caster is viewed in the most favorable way.
Thus, a charmed creature would not obey a suicide command, but might believe the caster if assured that the only chance to save the caster's life is for the creature to hold back an onrushing red dragon for \"just a minute or two\" and if the charmed creature's view of the situation suggests that this course of action still allows a reasonable chance of survival.
The subject's attitudes and priorities are changed with respect to the caster, but basic personality and alignment are not. A request that a victim make itself defenseless, give up a valued item, or even use a charge from a valued item (especially against former associates or allies) might allow an immediate saving throw to see if the charm is thrown off. Likewise, a charmed creature does not necessarily reveal everything it knows or draw maps of entire areas. Any request may be refused, if such refusal is in character and does not directly harm the caster. The victim's regard for the caster does not necessarily extend to the caster's friends or allies. The victim does not react well to the charmer's allies making suggestions such as, \"Ask him this question. . .,\" nor does the charmed creature put up with verbal or physical abuse from the charmer's associates, if this is out of character.
Note also that the spell does not empower the caster with linguistic capabilities beyond those he normally has. The duration of the spell is a function of the charmed creature's Intelligence, and it is tied to the saving throw. A successful saving throw breaks the spell.
This saving throw is checked on a periodic basis according to the creature's Intelligence, even if the caster has not overly strained the relationship.
Intelligence Score Period Between Checks 3 or less 3 months 4-6 2 months 7-9 1 month 10-12 3 weeks 13-14 2 weeks 15-16 1 week 17 3 days 18 2 days 19 or more 1 day If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed creature by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed creature, the charm is broken automatically.
If the subject of the charm person/charm mammal spell successfully rolls its saving throw vs. the spell, the effect is negated.
This spell, if used in conjunction with the animal friendship spell, can keep the animal near the caster's home base, if the caster must leave for an extended period."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell enables a priest to conjure up a weak air elemental--a dust devil of AC 4, 2 HD, MV 180 feet per round, one attack for 1d4 points of damage--which can be hit by normal weapons. The dust devil appears as a small whirlwind 1 foot in diameter at its base, 5 feet tall, and 3 to 4 feet across at the top. It moves as directed by the priest, but dissipates if it is ever separated from the caster by more than 30 yards. Its winds are sufficient to put out torches, small campfires, exposed lanterns, and other small, open flames of nonmagical origin. The dust devil can hold a gas cloud or a creature in gaseous form at bay or push it away from the caster (though it cannot damage or disperse such a cloud). If skimming along the ground in an area of loose dust, sand, or ash, the dust devil picks up those particles and disperses them in a 10-foot-diameter cloud centered on itself.
The cloud obscures normal vision, and creatures caught within are blinded while inside and for one round after they emerge. A spellcaster caught in the dust devil or its cloud while casting must make a saving throw vs. spell to keep his concentration, or the spell is ruined. Any creature native to the Elemental Plane of Air--even another dust devil--can disperse a dust devil with a single hit."}</textarea>

"description":"The ethereal barrier is a defense against the passage of extradimensional creatures, including characters or monsters that are phased, ethereal, or travelling via dimension door or shadow walk. The priest creates an imperceptible barrier of 10 square feet per level that may be arranged in any fashion the priest desires. For example, a 3rd-level character can ward six 10-foot by 10-foot surfaces, which would be sufficient to guard a 10-foot by 10-foot by 10-foot room (four walls, a ceiling, and a floor need to be protected.) Note that some monsters may be capable of abandoning their ethereal approach in order to simply enter the barred area on their own feet-the ethereal barrier only bars their passage as long as they are traveling in the Border Ethereal. Also, while this spell can't be worn down by any form of attack, it does not bar teleportation, gates, or the passage of astral creatures.
Ethereal barrier may be cast as cooperative magic by several priests working together. As long as all involved characters can cast the spell, the areas of effect of each priest are added together. Total the levels of all priests involved and multiply by two to find the number of 10-foot by 10-foot squares that may be warded. For example, four 6th-level casters (24 total levels) can ward 48 10-foot by 10-foot squares. The duration is determined by the highest level priest involved, plus 1 turn for each additional priest. In the previous example, this would be 6 turns plus 3 turns for three additional priests for a total of 9 turns.
This spell is also suitable for focus magic (see the spell focus in the Tome of Magic). The material component is a special compound of rare earths and lead worth at least 10 gp per application. One application is required for each 10-foot by 10-foot square to be warded."}</textarea>

"description":"When a priest casts a find traps spell, all traps--concealed normally or magically--of magical or mechanical nature become apparent to him. Note that this spell is directional, and the caster must face the desired direction in order to determine if a trap is laid in that particular direction.
A trap is any device or magical ward that meets three criteria: it can inflict a sudden or unexpected result, the spellcaster would view the result as undesirable or harmful, and the harmful or undesirable result was specifically intended as such by the creator. Thus, traps include alarms, glyphs, and similar spells or devices.
The caster learns the general nature of the trap (magical or mechanical) but not its exact effect, nor how to disarm it. Close examination will, however, enable the caster to sense what intended actions might trigger it. Note that the caster's divination is limited to his knowledge of what might be unexpected and harmful. The spell cannot predict actions of creatures (hence, a concealed murder hole or ambush is not a trap), nor are natural hazards considered traps (a cavern that floods during a rain, a wall weakened by age, a naturally poisonous plant, etc.). If the DM is using specific glyphs or sigils to identify magical wards (see the 3rd-level spell glyph of warding), this spell shows the form of the glyph or mark.

"description":"This spell holds 1d4 humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile and in place for a minimum of six rounds (the spell lasts 2 rounds per caster level, and the priest must be of at least 3rd level to cast the spell).
The hold person spell affects any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man size or smaller, including brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, halfelves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be held, while an ogre could not.
The effect is centered on a point selected by the caster, and it affects persons selected by the caster within the area of effect. If the spell is cast at three persons, each gets a normal saving throw; if only two persons are being enspelled, each rolls his saving throw with a -1 penalty; if the spell is cast at only one person, the saving throw die roll suffers a -2 penalty. Saving throws are adjusted for Wisdom. Those who succeed on their saving throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.
Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison. The priest casting the hold person spell can end the spell with a single utterance at any time; otherwise, the duration is six rounds at 3rd level, eight rounds at 4th level, etc.
The spellcaster needs a small, straight piece of iron as the material component of this spell."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">This spell holds 1d4 humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile and in place for a minimum of six rounds (the spell lasts 2 rounds per caster level, and the priest must be of at least 3rd level to cast the spell).<br />The hold person spell affects any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man size or smaller, including brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, halfelves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be held, while an ogre could not.<br />The effect is centered on a point selected by the caster, and it affects persons selected by the caster within the area of effect. If the spell is cast at three persons, each gets a normal saving throw; if only two persons are being enspelled, each rolls his saving throw with a -1 penalty; if the spell is cast at only one person, the saving throw die roll suffers a -2 penalty. Saving throws are adjusted for Wisdom. Those who succeed on their saving throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.<br />Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects&#039; condition due to wounds, disease, or poison. The priest casting the hold person spell can end the spell with a single utterance at any time; otherwise, the duration is six rounds at 3rd level, eight rounds at 4th level, etc.<br />The spellcaster needs a small, straight piece of iron as the material component of this spell.</div>

Music of the spheres can affect one creature per three levels of the priest (one subject at 3rd level, two at 6th level, etc.). Subjects must be within a 20-foot-diameter circle.
Potential victims must have Intelligence of at least 1 (necessary to understand the concept of music) and must be able to hear the music (i.e., they cannot be deaf and there can be nothing obstructing the victim's ears). This also means that the level of background noise must be low enough for the music to be audible. The DM should assume that the music is the same volume as an average human's normal speaking voice.

"description":"This spell is one of the few cooperative spells that requires one priest to cast the transfer spell, but another priest to use its effect. On one round, a priest (or priests) casts the mystic transfer. The spell is then active for the remaining nine rounds of the turn.
Mystic transfer allows a priest to receive spells from another priest of the same ethos.
Any priest of the same religion can cast a spell and transfer it to a second priest within that spell's maximum range. The spell does not take effect; instead, it is channelled through the mystic transfer into the receiving priest. This priest must immediately cast the spell or pass it to another priest cloaked in a mystic transfer within the spell's range. Any number of transfers can be made in the same round, provided each new recipient is within spell range of the previous recipient. If the spell is not transferred, the spell takes effect.
For example, a 3rd-level priest casts a mystic transfer. On the following round, a 10th-level priest \"passes\" a flame strike to the 3rd-level priest. The two priests could be 60 yards apart (the maximum range of the flame strike). The 3rd-level priest could then use the flame strike to attack any target within 60 yards, or could pass the spell on to another priest who has an active mystic transfer.
The spell passed by the mystic transfer has the range, area of effect, damage, and other effects equal to the level of the original caster. In the example above, the flame strike would function as if cast by a 10th-level priest.
The mystic transfer does not require concentration. However, on any round in which a priest is receiving and/or transferring a spell, the caster cannot take any other significant action.
A priest can receive spells only from priests who worship the same deity and who specifically target spells to him. Area effect spells may be passed. A priest can never use mystic transfer to pluck an opponent's spells out of the air."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">This spell is one of the few cooperative spells that requires one priest to cast the transfer spell, but another priest to use its effect. On one round, a priest (or priests) casts the mystic transfer. The spell is then active for the remaining nine rounds of the turn.<br />Mystic transfer allows a priest to receive spells from another priest of the same ethos.<br />Any priest of the same religion can cast a spell and transfer it to a second priest within that spell&#039;s maximum range. The spell does not take effect; instead, it is channelled through the mystic transfer into the receiving priest. This priest must immediately cast the spell or pass it to another priest cloaked in a mystic transfer within the spell&#039;s range. Any number of transfers can be made in the same round, provided each new recipient is within spell range of the previous recipient. If the spell is not transferred, the spell takes effect.<br />For example, a 3rd-level priest casts a mystic transfer. On the following round, a 10th-level priest &quot;passes&quot; a flame strike to the 3rd-level priest. The two priests could be 60 yards apart (the maximum range of the flame strike). The 3rd-level priest could then use the flame strike to attack any target within 60 yards, or could pass the spell on to another priest who has an active mystic transfer.<br />The spell passed by the mystic transfer has the range, area of effect, damage, and other effects equal to the level of the original caster. In the example above, the flame strike would function as if cast by a 10th-level priest.<br />The mystic transfer does not require concentration. However, on any round in which a priest is receiving and/or transferring a spell, the caster cannot take any other significant action.<br />A priest can receive spells only from priests who worship the same deity and who specifically target spells to him. Area effect spells may be passed. A priest can never use mystic transfer to pluck an opponent&#039;s spells out of the air.</div>

"description":"This cooperative spell allows the priests to create a beneficial atmosphere within a specified area. Companions of similar alignment to the casters will feel fortified and encouraged while in the sanctified area. The spell can be cast by a single priest or a group of priests.
After casting sanctify, the affected area is imbued with the deity's majesty. For followers of that deity, the area radiates a holy aura. These followers gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against all fear- and charm-based powers (a +2 to morale for BATTLESYSTEM rules units). Persons of the same alignment as the caster but of different faiths gain a +1 to saving throws (+1 in BATTLESYSTEM rules). The effect applies only as long as the characters remain in the sanctified area.
Creatures intent on harming the priest or his followers suffer a -1 on saving throws vs.
fear and charm (-1 to morale for BATTLESYSTEM rules units) when on sanctified ground.
Undead creatures within the area are easier to turn; any priest standing on sanctified ground turns undead as if he were one level higher.
Although this spell can be cast by a single priest, it is most effective when cast by several priests at once. The duration of the spell is equal to one round per level of the caster. When several priests cast the spell, the level of the most powerful priest is used, with two rounds added for every contributing priest. Thus, one 8th-level and three 6thlevel priests would give the spell a duration of 14 rounds (8+2+2+2).
Sanctify is often used in conjunction with focus to protect the grounds of a temple or encourage men defending a castle.
The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a handful of dirt from the grounds of an existing temple of the same faith.
The reverse of this spell, defile, functions in an identical manner with respect to saving throws for charm and fear. However, priests standing on defiled ground who attempt to turn undead do so at one level lower than their current level.
The material components for the reverse are the priest's holy symbol and a handful of earth from a grave."}</textarea>

"description":"By calling upon his deity, the caster of a spiritual hammer spell brings into existence a field of force shaped vaguely like a hammer. As long as the caster concentrates upon the hammer, it strikes at any opponent within its range, as desired. Each round the caster can choose to attack the same target as the previous round or switch to a new target that he can see anywhere within his maximum range. The spiritual hammer's chance to successfully hit is equal to that of the caster, without any Strength bonuses. In addition, it strikes as a magical weapon with a bonus of +1 for every six experience levels (or fraction) of the spellcaster, up to a total of +3 to the attack roll and +3 to the damage roll for a 13th-level caster. The base damage inflicted when it scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal war hammer (1d4+1 points on opponents of man size or smaller, or 1d4 points on larger opponents, plus the magical bonus). The hammer strikes in the same direction as the caster is facing, so if he is behind the target, all bonuses for rear attack are gained along with the loss of any modifications to the target's AC for shield and Dexterity.
As soon as the caster ceases concentration, the spiritual hammer spell ends. A dispel magic spell that includes either the caster or the force in its area of effect has a chance to dispel the spiritual hammer. If an attacked creature has magic resistance, the resistance is checked the first time the spiritual hammer strikes. If the hammer is successfully resisted, the spell is lost. If not, the hammer has its normal full effect for the duration of the spell.
The material component of this spell is a normal war hammer that the priest must hurl toward opponents while uttering a plea to his deity. The hammer disappears when the spell is cast."}</textarea>

Thus, at 1st level, a caster might be able to warp a hand axe handle or four crossbow bolts; at 5th level, he could warp the shaft of a typical spear.

Enchanted wood is affected only if the spellcaster is of higher level than the caster of the prior enchantment. The spellcaster has a 20% cumulative chance of success per level of difference (20% if one level higher, 40% if two levels higher, etc.).

It is typically used to guard some area against intrusion. Any creature approaching within 10 feet of the guarded area may be affected by the \"wyvern.\" Any creature entering the guarded area must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or stand paralyzed for one round per level of the caster, until freed by the spellcaster, by a dispel magic spell, or by a remove paralysis spell. A successful saving throw indicates that the subject creature was missed by the attack of the wyvernform, and the spell remains in place. As soon as a subject creature is successfully struck by the wyvern-form, the paralysis takes effect and the force of the spell dissipates. The spell force likewise dissipates if no intruder is struck by the wyvern-form for eight hours after the spell is cast. Any creature approaching the space being guarded by the wyvernform may be able to detect its presence before coming close enough to be attacked; this chance of detection is 90% in bright light, 30% in twilight conditions, and 0% in darkness.

Any creature approaching within 10 feet of the guarded area may be affected by the &quot;wyvern.&quot; Any creature entering the guarded area must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or stand paralyzed for one round per level of the caster, until freed by the spellcaster, by a dispel magic spell, or by a remove paralysis spell. A successful saving throw indicates that the subject creature was missed by the attack of the wyvernform, and the spell remains in place. As soon as a subject creature is successfully struck by the wyvern-form, the paralysis takes effect and the force of the spell dissipates. The spell force likewise dissipates if no intruder is struck by the wyvern-form for eight hours after the spell is cast. Any creature approaching the space being guarded by the wyvernform may be able to detect its presence before coming close enough to be attacked; this chance of detection is 90% in bright light, 30% in twilight conditions, and 0% in darkness.<br />The material component is the priest&#039;s holy symbol.</div>

"description":"This spell creates the lowest of the undead monsters, skeletons or zombies, usually from the bones or bodies of dead humans, demihumans, or humanoids. The spell causes these remains to become animated and obey the simple verbal commands of the caster, regardless of how they communicated in life. The skeletons or zombies can follow the caster, remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific type of creature) entering the place, etc. The undead remain animated until they are destroyed in combat or are turned; the magic cannot be dispelled.
The priest can animate one skeleton or one zombie for each experience level he has attained. If creatures with more than 1+ Hit Dice are animated, the number is determined by the monster Hit Dice. Skeletal forms have the Hit Dice of the original creature, while zombie forms have 1 more Hit Die. Thus, a 12th-level priest could animate 12 dwarven skeletons (or six zombies), four zombie gnolls, or a single zombie fire giant. Note that this is based on the standard racial Hit Die norm; thus, a high-level adventurer would be animated as a skeleton or zombie of 1 or 2 Hit Dice, and without special class or racial abilities. The caster can, alternatively, animate two small animal skeletons (1-1 Hit Die or less) for every level of experience he has achieved.
The spell requires a drop of blood, a piece of flesh of the type of creature being animated, and a pinch of bone powder or a bone shard to complete the spell. Casting this spell is not a good act, and only evil priests use it frequently."}</textarea>

Continual light brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) cancels the darkness so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. A direct casting of a continual light spell against a similar or weaker magical darkness cancels both.
This spell eventually consumes the material it is cast upon, but the process takes far longer than the time in a typical campaign. Extremely hard and expensive materials might last hundreds or even thousands of years.

If the saving throw is failed, a nondamaging magical blindness or deafness results.<br />A deafened creature can react only to what it can see or feel, and suffers a -1 penalty to surprise rolls, a +1 penalty to its initiative rolls, and a 20% chance of spell failure for spells with verbal components. A blinded creature suffers a -4 penalty to its attack rolls, a +4 penalty to its Armor Class, and a +2 penalty to its initiative rolls.</div>

"description":"This spell enables the caster to cure most diseases by placing his hand upon the diseased creature. The affliction rapidly disappears thereafter, making the cured creature whole and well in from one turn to 10 days, depending on the type of disease and the state of its advancement when the cure took place. (The DM must adjudicate these conditions.) The spell is also effective against parasitic monsters such as green slime, rot grubs, and others. When cast by a priest of at least 12th level, this spell cures lycanthropy if cast within three days of the infection. Note that the spell does not prevent reoccurrence of a disease if the recipient is again exposed.
The reverse of the cure disease spell is cause disease. To be effective, the priest must touch the intended victim, and the victim must fail a saving throw vs. spell. The severity of the disease is decided by the priest (debilitating or fatal). The exact details of the disease are decided by the DM, but the following are typical: Debilitating: The disease takes effect in 1d6 turns, after which the creature loses 1 point of Strength per hour until his Strength is reduced to 2 or less, at which time the recipient is weak and virtually helpless. If a creature has no Strength rating, it loses 10% of its hit points per Strength loss, down to 10% of its original hit points. If the disease also affects hit points, use the more severe penalty. Recovery requires a period of 1d3 weeks.
Fatal: This wasting disease is effective immediately. Infected creatures receive no benefit from cure wound spells while the disease is in effect; wounds heal at only 10% of the natural rate. The disease proves fatal within 1d6 months and can be cured only by magical means. Each month the disease progresses, the creature loses 2 points of Charisma, permanently.
The inflicted disease can be cured by the cure disease spell. Lycanthropy cannot be caused."}</textarea>

"description":"When a priest casts this spell, it has a chance to neutralize or negate the magic it comes in contact with as follows: First, it has a chance to remove spells and spell-like effects (including device effects and innate abilities) from creatures or objects. Second, it may disrupt the casting or use of these in the area of effect at the instant the dispel is cast. Third, it may destroy magical potions (which are treated as 12th level for purposes of this spell).
Each effect or potion in the spell's area is checked to determine if it is dispelled. The caster can always dispel his own magic; otherwise, the chance depends on the difference in level between the magical effect and the caster. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 11 or higher on 1d20. If the caster is of higher level than the creator of the effect to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted from this base number needed. If the caster is of lower level, the difference is added to the base. A die roll of 20 always succeeds and a die roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic he is trying to dispel, only a roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dispelled.
A dispel magic can affect only a specially enchanted item (such as a magical scroll, ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous item, weapon, shield, or armor) if it is cast directly upon the item. This renders the item nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An item possessed or carried by a creature has the creature's saving throw against this effect; otherwise, it is automatically rendered nonoperational. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) rendered nonoperational is temporarily closed. Note that an item's physical properties are unchanged: A nonoperational magical sword is still a sword.
Artifacts and relics are not subject to this spell, but some of their spell-like effects may be, at the DM's option.
Note that this spell, if successful, will release charmed and similarly beguiled creatures. Certain spells or effects cannot be dispelled; these are listed in the spell descriptions.

"description":"This spell can be cast in one of two ways: in a manner that affects the priest, or in a manner that affects a subject other than the priest.
The first method affects only the priest and allows him to shield his true emotions from magical examination. Thus, it can block wizard spells such as ESP or priest spells such as emotion read. While emotion control is in effect, anyone using one of these spells will sense the emotion designated by the priest rather than his true emotions. When the priest casts emotion control, he designates the false emotion he wishes to be revealed.
This use of emotion control also gives the priest a +2 bonus to saving throws against the following spells: spook, taunt, irritation, know alignment, scare, emotion, fear, and phantasmal killer. When any of these spells are cast on the priest, he is immediately aware of the attempt, although he does not learn the source of the spell.
If another character casts emotion read, ESP, or a similar spell on the priest, the priest must make a saving throw vs. spells with a +1 bonus for each 5 levels of the priest. If the priest successfully saves, the other spellcaster reads the false emotion; if the priest fails the saving throw, the spellcaster reads the priest's true emotion.
The second use of this spell allows the priest to create a single emotional reaction in the subject(s) (similar to the wizard spell emotion). Some typical emotions follow, but the DM may allow other similar effects.
Courage: The subject becomes berserk, gaining +1 to attack rolls and +3 to damage, and temporarily gaining 4 hit points (damage against the subject is deducted from these temporary points first). The subject need never check morale, and receives a +5 bonus to saving throws against the various forms of fear. Courage counters (and is countered by) fear.
Fear: The subject flees from the priest for the duration of the spell, even if this takes him out of spell range. Fear counters (and is countered by) courage.
Friendship: The subject reacts positively to any encounter; in game terms, any result of a roll on the Encounter Reactions table (Table 59 in the DMG ) is moved one column to the left. Thus, a threatening PC becomes cautious, an indifferent PC becomes friendly, etc. Friendship counters (and is countered by) hate.
Happiness: The subject experiences feelings of warmth, well-being, and confidence, modifying all reaction rolls by +3. The subject is unlikely to attack unless provoked.
Happiness counters (and is countered by) sadness.
Hate: The subject reacts negatively to any encounter; in game terms, any result of a roll on the Encounter Reactions table is moved one column to the right (i.e., a friendly PC becomes indifferent, a cautious PC becomes threatening, etc.). Hate counters (and is countered by) friendship.
Hope: The subject's morale is improved by +2. His saving throw rolls, attack, and damage rolls are all improved by +1 while this emotion is in effect. Hope counters (and is countered by) hopelessness.
Hopelessness: The subject's morale suffers a -10 penalty. In addition, in the round in which the emotion is initially established, all subjects must immediately make a morale check. Hopelessness counters (and is countered by) hope.
Sadness: The subject feels uncontrollably glum and is prone to fits of morose introspection. All attack rolls suffer a -1 penalty and initiative rolls suffer a +1 penalty.
The subject's chance of being surprised is increased by -2. Sadness counters (and is countered by) happiness.
All subjects of the second version, even willing targets, must save vs. spell to resist the emotion. In addition to all other modifiers, the saving throw is modified by -1 for every three levels of the priest casting the spell.
The material component for both versions of the spell is a small bunch of fleece or uncarded wool that is consumed in the casting."}</textarea>

In addition to all other modifiers, the saving throw is modified by -1 for every three levels of the priest casting the spell.<br />The material component for both versions of the spell is a small bunch of fleece or uncarded wool that is consumed in the casting.</div>

While ethereal, the priest cannot be detected by any means short of a true seeing or detect phase spell. He perceives his surroundings as misty, gray, and otherworldly.

"description":"A glyph of warding is a powerful inscription magically drawn to prevent unauthorized or hostile creatures from passing, entering, or opening. It can be used to guard a small bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap on a chest or box.
The priest must set the conditions of the ward; typically any creature violating the warded area without speaking the name of the glyph is subject to the magic it stores. A successful saving throw vs. spell enables the creature to escape the effects of the glyph.
Glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics, such as creature type, size, and weight. Glyphs can also be set with respect to good or evil, or to pass those of the caster's religion. They cannot be set according to class, Hit Dice, or level. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area; although if a cabinet had three drawers, each could be separately warded.
When the spell is cast, the priest weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. For every 5 square feet of area to be protected, one round is required to trace the warding lines of the glyph. The caster can affect an area equal to a square the sides of which are the same as his level, in feet. The glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of the caster's total square footage. Thus, a 6th-level caster could place a glyph on a 6-foot x 6-foot square, a 4-foot x 9-foot rectangle, a 2-foot x 18- foot band, or a 1-foot by 36-foot strip. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become invisible.
The priest traces the glyph with incense, which, if the area exceeds 50 square feet, must be sprinkled with powdered diamond (at least 2,000 gp worth).
Typical glyphs shock for 1d4 points of electrical damage per level of the spellcaster, explode for a like amount of fire damage, paralyze, blind, deafen, and so forth. The DM may allow any harmful priest spell effect to be used as a glyph, provided the caster is of sufficient level to cast the spell. Successful saving throws either reduce effects by onehalf or negate them, according to the glyph employed. Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled by magic and foiled by high-level thieves using their find-and-remove-traps skill.
The DM may decide that the exact glyphs available to a priest depend on his religion, and he might make new glyphs available according to the magical research rules."}</textarea>

The field causes 1d3 points of damage to all creatures passing through it; evil creatures and undead suffer 1d8 points of damage from the field. Creatures that roll a successful saving throw suffer no damage. Creatures that can fly over the field, burrow under it, or teleport to the other side are immune to damage.
If the spell is cast in its portable form, the priests can move at half their movement rates (limited to the rate of the slower priest). The priests can take no other action, since all their energy is spent in walking and maintaining the field.
Once created, the field cannot be increased or decreased in length and must remain straight. The priests could maneuver by pivoting, but could not walk toward each other or bend the field around a corner. If the line of sight between the two priests is blocked by any object of greater than 5' diameter, the spell immediately fails. Thus, creatures, low walls, young trees, pillars, and similar objects will not disrupt the spell.
As a cooperative spell, several priests can link together to create a longer field. Each priest (or sigil) forms the end of one field and the beginning of another, much like fenceposts. Each section of the spell must extend in a straight line, but the field can be bent at each junction. Four priests could form a long line, a square, or a Z pattern. The restrictions on moving the fields apply as outlined above. The DM may apply movement penalties depending on the complexity of the pattern.
The material components are the priests' croziers, staves, or religious standards, held aloft by each caster.
The reverse of this spell, line of destruction, causes 1d3 damage to all creatures passing through it. It causes 1d8 damage to paladins and creatures of good alignment who pass through it. Creatures that roll a successful saving throw suffer no damage."}</textarea>

The first causes normal vegetation to grow, entwine, and entangle to form a thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or force a way through at a movement rate of 10 feet per round (or 20 feet per round for larger-than-man-sized creatures). Note that the area must have brush and trees in it in order for this spell to take effect. Briars, bushes, creepers, lianas, roots, saplings, thistles, thorn, trees, vines, and weeds become so thick and overgrown in the area of effect as to form a barrier. The area of effect is a square 20 feet on a side per level of experience of the caster, in any square or rectangular shape that the caster decides upon at the time of the spellcasting. Thus, an 8th-level caster can affect a maximum area of a 160-foot x 160-foot square, a 320-foot x 80-foot rectangle, a 640-foot x 40-foot rectangle, a 1,280-foot x 20-foot rectangle, etc. The spell's effects persist in the area until it is cleared by labor, fire, or such magical means as a dispel magic spell.
The second use of the spell affects a one-mile square area. The DM secretly makes a saving throw (based on the caster's level) to see if the spell takes effect. If successful, the spell renders plants more vigorous, fruitful, and hardy, increasing yields by 20% to 50% ([1d4+1] x 10%), given a normal growing season. The spell does not prevent disaster in the form of floods, drought, fire, or insects, although even in these cases the plants survive better than expected. This effect lasts only for the life cycle of one season, the winter \"death\" marking the end of a life cycle even for the sturdiest of trees.

				<div class="description-content">By means of the prayer spell, the priest brings special favor upon himself and his party and causes harm to his enemies. Those in the area at the instant the spell is completed are affected for the duration of the spell. When the spell is completed, all attack and damage rolls and saving throws made by those in the area of effect who are friendly to the priest gain +1 bonuses, while those of the priest&#039;s enemies suffer -1 penalties. Once the prayer spell is uttered, the priest can do other things, unlike a chant, which he must continue to make the spell effective. If another priest of the same religious persuasion (not merely the same alignment) is chanting when a prayer is cast, the effects combine to +2 and -2, as long as both are in effect at once.<br />The priest needs a silver holy symbol, prayer beads, or a similar device as the material component of this spell.</div>

"description":"Upon casting this spell, the priest is usually able to remove a curse on an object, on a person, or in the form of some undesired sending or evil presence. Note that the remove curse spell does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, for example, although the spell typically enables the person afflicted with any such cursed item to get rid of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell, or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or more. A caster of 12th level or more can cure lycanthropy with this spell by casting it on the animal form. The were-creature receives a saving throw vs. spell and, if successful, the spell fails and the priest must gain a level before attempting the remedy on this creature again.
The reverse of the spell is not permanent; the bestow curse spell lasts for one turn for every experience level of the priest using the spell. The curse can have one of the following effects (roll percentile dice): 50% of the time it reduces one ability of the victim to 3 (the DM randomly determines which ability); 25% of the time it lowers the victim's attack and saving throw rolls by -4; 25% of the time it makes the victim 50% likely to drop whatever he is holding (or do nothing, in the case of creatures not using tools)--roll each round.
It is possible for a priest to devise his own curse, and it should be similar in power to those given here. Consult your DM. The subject of a bestow curse spell must be touched.
If the victim is touched, a saving throw is still applicable; if it is successful, the effect is negated. The bestowed curse cannot be dispelled.
Example of Dwarven Curse forged into armor: Non dwarven thanes who wear this armor lose 1 point of con per week or fraction thereof. Theft of armor applies as well. Beards will fall out over time.
Example of Dwarven Cruse forged into weapons: 50% chance to drop the weapon each round if wielded by a non-dwarf. Fumbled weapons are useless and always dropped, even if it is picked up again."}</textarea>

"description":"Repair injury is intended for use in campaigns featuring the critical hit or critical strike rules. This spell addresses one specific injury or wound (see Chapter 8). It can be used to knit a broken bone, alleviate the swelling and pain of a sprain or a twist, or repair soft-tissue damage such as an injured eye, ear, or a severed tendon. If used as a simple curing spell, repair injury restores 1d10+1 hit points to the injured character, but if used to address the effects of a specific injury, repair injury automatically removes one grazed, struck, injured, or broken condition, and alleviates any combat, movement, or maximum hit point penalties associated with the injury in question. The spell does not restore any lost hit points to the victim, other than the 1d10+1 that are incidental to the working of the spell.
Beran, a fighter with 44 hit points, is struck by an ogre's club. The blow inflicts 12 points of damage, but Beran also suffers a broken hip. This injury will reduce him to a maximum of 25% of his normal total, so Beran's current hit points drop from 32 to 11 after the battle ends. In addition, he is not capable of moving or attacking due to the effects of the injury.
When the smoke clears, Talmos the priest comes to Beran's aid. Using repair injury, he knits Beran's broken hip. The spell cures 6 hit points in the process. Beran no longer suffers the movement or attack penalties for a broken hip and has 17 hit points to his credit. With time or additional healing, he can regain his normal total of 44.
Repair injury is also helpful in dealing with wounds that fall in the crushed, shattered, or destroyed category. This spell reduces the severity of the injury to the broken level, which means it heals as if it were 20d6 lost hit points. Only one repair injury can be used on any given wound, so a character with a shattered knee could still require a lot of time to recover after an application of this spell.
Severed limbs, destroyed eyes or ears, and ability score losses caused by injuries cannot be healed by this spell. Repair injury is the equivalent of cure serious wounds for the purpose of slowing or stopping bleeding."}</textarea>

"description":"Upon casting a speak with dead spell, the priest is able to ask several questions of a dead creature in a set period of time and receive answers according to the knowledge of that creature. Of course, the priest must be able to converse in the language that the dead creature once used. The length of time the creature has been dead is a factor, since only higher level priests can converse with a long-dead creature. The number of questions that can be answered and the length of time in which the questions can be asked depend on the level of experience of the priest. Even if the casting is successful, such creatures are as evasive as possible when questioned. The dead tend to give extremely brief and limited answers, often cryptic, and to take questions literally. Furthermore, their knowledge is often limited to what they knew in life.
A dead creature of different alignment or of higher level or Hit Dice than the caster's level receives a saving throw vs. spell. A dead creature that successfully saves can refuse to answer questions, ending the spell. At the DM's option, the casting of this spell on a given creature might be restricted to once per week.
The priest needs a holy symbol and burning incense in order to cast this spell upon the body, remains, or a portion thereof. The remains are not expended. This spell does not function under water.

The number of questions that can be answered and the length of time in which the questions can be asked depend on the level of experience of the priest. Even if the casting is successful, such creatures are as evasive as possible when questioned. The dead tend to give extremely brief and limited answers, often cryptic, and to take questions literally. Furthermore, their knowledge is often limited to what they knew in life.<br />A dead creature of different alignment or of higher level or Hit Dice than the caster&#039;s level receives a saving throw vs. spell. A dead creature that successfully saves can refuse to answer questions, ending the spell. At the DM&#039;s option, the casting of this spell on a given creature might be restricted to once per week.<br />The priest needs a holy symbol and burning incense in order to cast this spell upon the body, remains, or a portion thereof. The remains are not expended. This spell does not function under water.<br />Caster Level / Max Length of Time Dead / Time Questioned / # of Questions<br />1-7 / 1 week / 1 round / 2<br />7-8 / 1 month / 3 rounds / 3<br />9-12 / 1 year / 1 turn / 4<br />13-15 / 10 years / 2 turns / 5<br />16-20 / 100 years / 3 turns / 6<br />21+ / 1,000 years / 1 hour / 7</div>

For each 10 feet of movement through the area, the victim suffers 2d4 points of damage. He must also roll a saving throw vs. spell. If this saving throw is failed, the victim's movement rate is reduced by 1/3 of its current total (but a creature's movement rate can never be less than 1). This penalty lasts for 24 hours, after which the character's normal movement rate is regained.
Without the use of a spell such as true seeing, similar magical aids, or some other special means of detection (such as detect traps or detect snares and pits), an area affected by spike growth is absolutely undetectable as such until a victim enters the area and suffers damage. Even then, the creature cannot determine the extent of the perilous area unless some means of magical detection is used.

"description":"This spell summons a minor spirit or entity to the caster's aid. Clerics usually summon minor elementals of some kind, while shamans typically conjure an animal spirit or spirit of nature. Regardless of the spirit's origin, it appears as a ghostly beast of some kind-wolves, bears, tigers, or lions are most common. The animal spirit obeys the mental commands of the priest, attacking his enemies or performing any other task that it could reasonably accomplish. The creature is incorporeal and cannot handle or manipulate objects of any kind, but it can see and hear as a normal animal of its archetype and could be used to scout a dangerous area or act as a distraction of some kind.
In combat, the animal spirit has the following statistics: MV 24; AC 4; THAC0 15; Dmg 2d4. It can only be injured by magical weapons and can strike monsters hit only by +1 or better weapons. The spirit has a number of hit points equal to 10 plus the caster's level, so a 6th-level priest conjures a animal spirit with 16 hit points. The creature is not affected by charm, sleep, hold, or other mind-affecting spells and suffers no damage from cold-based attacks. However, it is vulnerable to dispel magic or turning as an undead monster of the caster's Hit Dice. If the animal spirit is turned, destroyed, or dispelled, the priest who summoned it must make a saving throw vs. spell or be stunned for 1d4 rounds.
Because the spirit is intelligent and free-willed under the caster's direction, the priest need not concentrate in order to direct its attacks-an animal spirit could be ordered to attack a spellcaster in the back of an enemy party, while the cleric waded into hand-to-hand combat. The animal spirit makes use of flank or rear attacks when it can and gains any normal combat bonuses that a living creature in its position would be entitled to. The priest enjoys instantaneous, silent communication with the animal spirit and can order it to stop attacking, to change its target, or to undertake almost any conceivable action desired. However, the spirit must remain within the spell's range; if it is ever more than 10 yards per caster level away from the priest, it dissipates harmlessly.
The material component is a small whistle carved from a bone taken from the appropriate type of animal."}</textarea>

"description":"The summon insects spell attracts a cloud or swarm of normal insects to attack the foes of the caster. Flying insects appear 70% of the time, while crawling insects appear 30% of the time. The exact insects called are bees, biting flies, hornets, or wasps, if flying insects are indicated; biting ants or pinching beetles, if crawling insects are indicated. A cloud of the flying type, or a swarm of the crawling sort, appears after the spell is cast.
This gathers at a point chosen by the caster, within the spell's range, and attacks any single creature the caster points to.
The attacked creature sustains 2 points of damage if it does nothing but attempt to flee or fend off the insects during the time it is attacked; it suffers 4 points of damage per round otherwise. If the insects are ignored, the victim fights with a -2 penalty to his attack roll and a +2 penalty to his Armor Class. If he attempts to cast a spell, an initiative roll should be made for the insects to see if their damage occurs before the spell is cast. If it does, the victim's concentration is ruined and the spell is lost.
The insects disperse and the spell ends if the victim enters thick smoke or hot flames.
Besides being driven off by smoke or hot flames, the swarm might possibly be outrun, or evaded by plunging into a sufficient body of water. If evaded, the summoned insects can be sent against another opponent, but there will be at least a 1 round delay while they leave the former opponent and attack the new victim. Crawling insects can travel only about 10 feet per round (maximum speed over smooth ground) and flying insects travel 60 feet per round. The caster must concentrate to maintain the swarm; it dissipates if he moves or is disturbed.
It is possible, in underground situations, that the caster might summon 1d4 giant ants by means of the spell, but the possibility is only 30% unless giant ants are nearby. This spell does not function under water.

Telepathy does not give either participant access to the other's thoughts, memories, or emotions.

A priest can establish separate \"telepathic channels\" to multiple individuals. Each linkage is established through a separate casting of the spell. There is no network between the channels. For example, Balfas the priest establishes telepathy with Alra the warrior and Zymor the thief by casting this spell twice. Balfas can communicate a single thought to both Alra and Zymor, but Alra and Zymor cannot communicate with each other. Balfas, however, can \"target\" a thought so that only one of the two participants receives it.

				<div class="description-content">By means of this spell, the caster is able to assume the form of a small living tree or shrub or that of a large dead tree trunk with only a few limbs. Although the closest inspection cannot reveal that this plant is actually a person, and for all normal tests he is, in fact, a tree or shrub, the caster is able to observe all that goes on around him just as if he were in normal form. The Armor Class and hit points of the plant are those of the caster. The caster can remove the spell at any time, instantly changing from plant to his normal form and having full capability for any action normally possible (including spellcasting). Note that all clothing and gear worn or carried change with the caster.<br />The material components of this spell are the priest&#039;s holy symbol and a twig from a tree.</div>

At the time of casting, the priests must be within 10 feet of each other. Upon completion of the spell, the priests sing a single, dissonant chord. The result of the spell depends on the number of voices in the choir.
Trio. In this form, the spell projects a cone of sonic force 120 feet long and 40 feet wide at the base. All creatures within the area of effect must save vs. spells or suffer 2d4 points of damage. Those who successfully save suffer only 1d4 points. Undead suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throws.
Quartet. With four voices, the spell has the same area of effect as described above.
However, all those who fail their saving throw suffer 2d4 points of damage and are deafened for one round. Those who successfully save suffer half damage and are not deafened. Undead creatures are not allowed a saving throw.
Quintet. Five singers produce a chord of major power. All within the area of effect suffer 3d4 points of damage (saving throw for half damage). Undead are not allowed a saving throw. All creatures are deafened for one round. Furthermore, pottery, glassware, crystal, and similar breakable goods must save vs. fall or be shattered.
Ensemble. An ensemble of singers consists of six to ten priests. In this case, the area of effect increases to a cone 180 feet long and 60 feet wide at the base. All creatures within this area suffer 1d4 points of damage per priest and are deafened for 1d4 rounds.
A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces the damage and duration of deafness by half.
Undead creatures of 3 hit dice or less are immediately destroyed. All other undead suffer normal damage, but are not allowed a saving throw. Glass, pottery, crystal, bone, and all wooden items that are the strength of a door or less (chests, tables, chairs, etc.) must save vs. crushing blow or be shattered.
Choir. The most powerful group, a choir, requires eleven or more priests. In this case, the area of effect expands to a cone 300 feet long and 100 feet wide at the base. All within the area of effect suffer 1d6 points of damage per priest to a maximum of 20d6. A saving throw vs. spells reduces the damage to half. Those who fail to save are deafened for 1d10 rounds; those who succeed are deafened only 1d6 rounds. Undead creatures of 5 hit dice or less are immediately destroyed. Undead with more hit dice are not allowed a saving throw. Structures within the area of effect are damaged as if they suffered a direct hit from a catapult (one hit per four priests in the choir). Doors, chests, and other breakable items are instantly shattered."}</textarea>

For example, if the priest was about to open a trapped chest, the unfailing premonition would create a flash of insight or a gut feeling telling him that he shouldn't do so.
Similarly, opening a door that leads into the lair of a ferocious troll may also trigger the spell's warning. Threatening a NPC who is likely to respond by drawing a weapon and attacking the PC would create a warning, but threatening a NPC who will get even with the priest in an hour or two will not trigger the premonition.
The unfailing premonition is also quite useful in combat, as long as the priest obeys his instincts and ducks, dodges, or withdraws when his subconscious tells him to.
While the spell is in effect, the priest gains a +2 bonus to his Armor Class and saving throws, but in any given round there is a 25% chance that he will have to forego his intended action in order to obey the spell's warning impulses.
The premonition only works on actions undertaken by the priest himself. If his companion is about to pull a mysterious lever that will drop a 10-ton block of stone on the priest, he receives no warning."}</textarea>

The reverse of this spell, cloak of fear, empowers a single creature touched to radiate a personal aura of fear, at will, out to a 3-foot radius. All other characters and creatures within this aura must roll successful saving throws vs. spell or run away in panic for 2d8 rounds. Affected individuals may or may not drop items, at the DM's option.
The spell has no effect upon undead of any sort. The effect can be used only once, and the spell expires after eight hours if not brought down sooner. Members of the recipient's party are not immune to the effects of the spell.
The material component for the cloak of bravery spell is the feather of an eagle or hawk. The reverse requires the tail feathers of a vulture or chicken."}</textarea>

The magic of the cloak of bravery spell works only once and then the spell ends, whether or not the creature&#039;s saving throw is successful. The spell ends after eight hours if no saving throw is required before then.<br />The reverse of this spell, cloak of fear, empowers a single creature touched to radiate a personal aura of fear, at will, out to a 3-foot radius. All other characters and creatures within this aura must roll successful saving throws vs. spell or run away in panic for 2d8 rounds. Affected individuals may or may not drop items, at the DM&#039;s option.<br />The spell has no effect upon undead of any sort. The effect can be used only once, and the spell expires after eight hours if not brought down sooner. Members of the recipient&#039;s party are not immune to the effects of the spell.<br />The material component for the cloak of bravery spell is the feather of an eagle or hawk. The reverse requires the tail feathers of a vulture or chicken.</div>

"description":"A divination spell is used to garner a useful piece of advice concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that will occur within a one-week period. This can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. Unlike the augury spell, this gives a specific piece of advice.
For example, if the question is \"Will we do well if we venture to the third level?\" and a terrible troll guarding 10,000 gp and a shield +1 lurks near the entrance to the level (the DM estimates the party could beat the troll after a hard fight), the divination response might be: \"Ready oil and open flame light your way to wealth.\" In all cases, the DM controls what information is received and whether additional divinations will supply additional information. Note that if the information is not acted upon, the conditions probably change so that the information is no longer useful (in the example, the troll might move away and take the treasure with it).
The base chance for a correct divination is 60%, plus 1% for each experience level of the priest casting the spell. The DM makes adjustments to this base chance considering the actions being divined (if, for example, unusual precautions against the spell have been taken). If the dice roll is failed, the caster knows the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.

"description":"This spell creates the necessary conditions for devotional energy to be used. For faith magic to work, the priest must create a focus to harness the necessary devotional energy.
This spell creates that focus. A focus cannot function without a source of devotional energy.
The focus gathers devotional energy and reshapes it in order to amplify other spells cast by the priest (or priests). The same energy keeps the focus in existence. If the spell is cast and there is no immediate source of devotional energy within 100 feet, the focus immediately fails.
Once created, most foci cannot be moved. This condition and the need for a constant supply of devotional energy tends to limit the use of foci to temples, churches, monasteries, shrines, and seminaries--permanent structures where followers of the religion gather on a regular basis. Sometimes a focus is created for a special gathering such as a holy day, conclave, grand wedding, or yearly festival.
Not all foci are identical. The particular form of the focus depends on the power and nature of the spell being amplified. All foci can be seen by detect magic. There are three basic types of foci: site, item, and living.
Site foci are connected to a place, whether a room, building, field, or forest. Once cast, the foci cannot be moved. It causes no disturbance in the surroundings; it is invisible and intangible.
Item foci are centered on a single object. Customarily, this object is large and immovable, such as an altar, but it is possible for the focus to be as small as is practical.
The item can be as elaborate or plain as desired, but should have some significance to the religion.
Living foci are the rarest of all types. In this case, the focus is created on a living plant, animal, or person. Detect charm reveals the person is somehow enchanted, although not under the influence of a typical charm spell.
The type of focus created (site, item, or living) depends on the religion and nature of the spell amplified. These choices are listed in Table 3: Focused Spell Effects.
Casting the focus spell is a long and complicated process, accompanied by many ceremonies and rituals. During the day spent casting the spell, the priest will need the assistance of at least two other priests of the same faith. These aides need not memorize the spell (or even be capable of casting it). Their duty is to provide the extra hands and voices needed at specific points of the casting. A large number of worshipers must also be present since the focus requires their energy. Not surprisingly, the casting of this spell is often incorporated into important holy festivals or special occasions.
The duration of the focus is one year. If the devotional energy falls below a minimum level, the spell ends sooner. A focus requires the devotional energy of at least 100 devout worshipers. Lay monks (those dedicated to the religion but not priests) count as two worshipers, while priests (of any level) count as ten. A focus could be maintained by a congregation of 100, a monastery of fifty, or a seminary of as few as 10 priests (or any combination of the above). The focus must receive this energy for at least 10 hours out of every day. If these conditions are not met, the focus weakens. The area of effect of the amplified spell decreases by 20% each day until it fades away completely.
Once the focus is created, the priest or priests have 1 turn in which to cast the desired spell upon the focus. A focus can amplify only one spell, and each item, creature, or place can receive only one focus. Spells that can be cast upon a focus are listed on Table 3.
Table 3: FOCUSED SPELL EFFECTS Possible Focus Spell Type Anti-animal shell S/I/L Anti-plant shell S/I/L Bless S/I Control temperature, 10' radius S* Control winds S/I* Cure disease I/L Cure blindness or deafness I/L Detect poison S/I Detect lie I Detect magic I Dispel evil S/I Endure cold/endure heat S* Know alignment I/L Negative plane protection S/I Protection from evil S/I Protection from lightning S Protections from fire S Purify food and drink I Remove fear S/I/L Remove curse I Repel insects S/I Resist fire/resist cold S Speak with animals S/I/L Tongues S/I True seeing S * The caster must state a desired range (temperature, wind strength, etc.) within the spell's normal limitations at the time it is cast.
Once the spell is cast, the normal duration and area of effect for that spell are ignored.
The focus begins to increase these factors of the spell's power. After one day, the amplified spell reaches its full area of effect. Thereafter, it remains over that area until the focus fails.
The area affected by the focus (and its amplified spell) depends on the level of the caster. The spell expands in a radius from the focus, 20 feet per level of the caster, although it can deliberately be created smaller. Within that area of effect, the amplified spell exerts its normal effect. A 13th-level priest could create a focus up to 260 feet in diameter.
The material components are many, including special vestments, incense, oils, waters, and other equipment the DM deems appropriate. The cost of these materials is never less than 1,000 gp plus 100 gp per level of spell being amplified. These items are given up as offerings to the deity (perhaps to be distributed to the poor), and new ones must be obtained each time the spell is cast."}</textarea>

"description":"By the use of this spell, the priest can transfer a limited number and selection of his currently memorized spells, and the ability to cast them, to another person. Only nonspellcasters (including rangers under 8th level and paladins under 9th level) can receive this bestowal; the imbue with spell ability enchantment does not function for those belonging to spellcasting classes, for unintelligent monsters, nor for any individual with less than 1 full Hit Die. In addition, the person thus imbued must have a Wisdom score of 9 or higher. Only priest spells of an informational or defensive nature or a cure light wounds spell can be transferred. Transferring any other spell type negates the entire attempt, including any allowable spells that were chosen. Higher level persons can receive more than one spell at the priest's option: Level of Recipient Spells Imbued 1 One 1st-level spell 3 Two 1st-level spells 5+ Two 1st- and one 2nd-level spells The transferred spell's variable characteristics (range, duration, area of effect, etc.) function according to the level of the priest originally imbuing the spell.
A priest who casts imbue with spell ability upon another character loses the number of 1st- and 2nd-level spells he has imbued until the recipient uses the transferred spells or is slain. For example, a 7th-level priest with five 1st- and four 2nd-level spells imbues a 10th-level fighter with a cure light wounds spell and a slow poison spell. The cleric now can have only four 1st-level spells memorized until the cure is cast and only three 2ndlevel spells until the slow poison is cast, or until the fighter is killed. In the meantime, the priest remains responsible to his ethos for the use to which the spell is put.
The material components for this spell are the priest's holy symbol, plus some minor item from the recipient that is symbolic of his profession (a lockpick for a thief, etc.).
This item, and any material component for the imbued spell, is consumed when the imbue with spell ability spell is cast."}</textarea>

In the meantime, the priest remains responsible to his ethos for the use to which the spell is put.<br />The material components for this spell are the priest&#039;s holy symbol, plus some minor item from the recipient that is symbolic of his profession (a lockpick for a thief, etc.).<br />This item, and any material component for the imbued spell, is consumed when the imbue with spell ability spell is cast.</div>

Unlike the 5th-level spell true seeing, the omniscient eye does not grant the caster the ability to perceive secret doors, traps, lost or misplaced objects, or creature alignments; it simply ensures that the caster can see the surroundings as they would appear without the interference of weather, lighting, or illusionary magic. Thus, the omniscient eye can be deceived by careful camouflage, concealment, or other purely physical precautions. Other phenomena that may bypass this spell's power include psionic invisibility, true transparency, or extradimensional objects or creatures.

"description":"By using this spell, the caster can place one willing subject in a state of suspended animation. The victim's breathing, heartbeat, and other vital processes slow to the point of nonexistence, although he or she seems to be deeply asleep, not dead. A caster of 7th to 10th level can maintain the suspended animation for up to one week plus one day per level; a caster of 11th to 15th level can maintain the state for up to one month plus one week per level; and a caster of 16th level or higher can place someone in suspended animation for one year plus one month per level.
This spell has many useful applications. First, all bodily or mental afflictions become quiescent during the victim's slumber. Poison, insanity, and many curses (lycanthropy, geas, and mummy rot included) can be arrested, if not cured, and have no effect on the subject while he sleeps. Of course, if the spell is broken prematurely, all the conditions that were halted by the spell will start once again. Second, the subject requires no food or water, but he still needs air and dies if deprived of oxygen. Third, for every month that the subject is in suspended animation, he recovers one hit point.
The caster can awaken the subject at any time within the spell's duration, although he must be in the subject's presence to do so. Optionally, the priest may pre-specify an amount of time within his normal duration or a special condition to awaken the sleeper. A condition must include a physical stimulus to the subject, such as a change in temperature, the touch of the sun, the kiss of a princess, or whatever the priest desires. If the priest maintaining the spell dies or is not able to awaken the sleeper, then the subject can be taken to another priest of the same deity to be awakened.
If the subject is attacked, he is completely helpless and can be killed by a single blow. However, if the subject is attacked without being slain for some reason, he gains a saving throw vs. spell each round to emerge from his suspended animation. The subject will be extremely groggy and disoriented if his slumber is disturbed in this fashion, suffering a -2 penalty to all die rolls for 1d6 turns, but if he awakens in the normal or prescribed fashion, he is disoriented for only one round.
Some of the drawbacks to this spell affect the casting priest. First of all, it takes all of the priest's concentration to cast and maintain this spell. This means that the priest cannot cast any other spell while a subject is being held under the influence of the suspended animation. For each week that the subject is in suspended animation, the priest loses one point of Constitution. This happens each week until the priest transfers the spell to another priest of the same alignment. Transferring this spell requires a successful saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw is successful, then the priest who transfers the spell can start recovering Constitution at a rate of one point per hour of bedrest. If the saving throw doesn't succeed, then the priest loses another point of Constitution and cannot try to transfer the spell again for 8 hours. Either way, because of the temporary lapse of the spell, the subject will automatically lose 1 hit point each time a transfer is attempted.
The material component for this spell is a rare herb that must be prepared with exacting care. The treatment costs at least 200 gold pieces and requires 1d3 days of the priest's time and attention."}</textarea>

"description":"Uplift bestows increased spellcasting ability on one priest, including additional spells per level and use of spells beyond the caster's normal level. This cooperative spell requires two priests who must spend the day casting this spell. During the casting, the priests must decide which additional spells (of all levels) are desired. Upon completion of the casting, the priests touch palms, and the priest of higher level receives a charge of magical energy. This charge temporarily boosts the level of the priest for spellcasting purposes. The amount of increase is one level per five levels of the lower level caster (fractions rounded up). If both priests are of equal level, the casters must decide who benefits from the spell.
The spell grants the priest the spellcasting ability of the new level. It does not improve hit points, attack rolls, or other abilities. If the increase allows more spells per level, the additional spells are instantly placed in the character's memory. A priest is also enabled to cast spells normally beyond his level. Range, duration, area of effect, and other variables are all based on the character's temporary level.
The increased effect lasts only 1 turn. At the end of the turn, all additional spells are lost and the character reverts to his normal level.
As an example, consider a party with a fallen comrade. The two priests in the party are 7th and 8th level, both unable to cast raise dead. After a night's rest, each priest adds uplift to his memorized spells. After casting the spell, the 8th-level priest suddenly gains the casting abilities of a 10th-level priest, including the ability to cast raise dead. At the end of one turn, the priest's abilities revert to 8th-level.
Casting this spell is an arduous task, causing a severe drain on the priests. When the spell expires, the uplifted character suffers 2d6 points of damage from mental exhaustion.
This damage cannot be healed by any means until the character has had at least eight hours of rest.
The material components are the priests' holy symbols and an offering worth at least 500 gp from each priest."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">Uplift bestows increased spellcasting ability on one priest, including additional spells per level and use of spells beyond the caster&#039;s normal level. This cooperative spell requires two priests who must spend the day casting this spell. During the casting, the priests must decide which additional spells (of all levels) are desired. Upon completion of the casting, the priests touch palms, and the priest of higher level receives a charge of magical energy. This charge temporarily boosts the level of the priest for spellcasting purposes. The amount of increase is one level per five levels of the lower level caster (fractions rounded up).

				<div class="description-content">The priest using this spell causes a summoned creature of evil nature, an evil creature from another plane, or a creature summoned by an evil caster, to return to its own plane or place when the caster successfully strikes it in melee combat. Examples of such creatures are aerial servants, djinn, efreet, elementals, and invisible stalkers. An evil enchantment (such as a charm spell cast by an evil creature) that is subject to a normal dispel magic spell can be automatically dispelled by the dispel evil spell. This spell lasts for a maximum of one round for each experience level of the caster, or until expended.<br />While the spell is in effect, all creatures that could be affected by it fight with a -7 penalty to their attack rolls when engaging the spellcaster.<br />The reverse of the spell, dispel good, functions against summoned or enchanted creatures of good alignment or creatures that have been sent to aid the cause of good.<br />The material components for this spell are the priest&#039;s religious object and holy (or unholy) water.</div>

"description":"This cooperative spell requires only one priest to cast it, but can be cast only on another priest of the same faith. The recipient of the spell must voluntarily surrender himself to the spell. The recipient becomes a host for the caster. While the recipient does not lose his own persona or ability to act, the host can be dominated by the caster at any time. For the most part, this domination is complete.
For the duration of the spell, the caster is essentially detached from his own body. He can neither move nor act on his own. His mind is connected to the host's. He sees, hears, smells, tastes, and otherwise senses everything the host does. He can telepathically communicate with the host. Once the spell is completed, there is no limit to the range over which it can function. However, both the caster and host must remain on the same plane. Since the spell relies on telepathic communication, thin lead sheeting will effectively block the connection.
When desired, the caster can dominate the host. When this happens, the host's own mind is pushed to the background and the caster's personality dominates. The host's personality, memories, proficiencies, and spells are temporarily replaced by those of the caster. While occupying the host, the caster can cast any spell he himself has memorized, provided that the necessary components are on hand. These spells function exactly as if the priest had cast them from his own body.
The caster can return control to the host at any time, restoring the character's abilities and personality without harm.
The spell is not without limitations and risks. The domination must be voluntary. If the host resists the casting of the spell, it automatically fails. Once the spell is in effect, the host can attempt to resist the domination. He is then allowed a saving throw. If successful, the spell immediately ends.
Whenever the host suffers damage, the caster must make a saving throw vs. death to maintain the spell. If the save is failed, a wave of pain is transmitted to the priest, causing 1d6 points of damage and canceling the spell. If the host should die, the caster must make a system shock roll with the risk of suffering instant death.
The material component is a chalice worth no less than 1,000 gp. This chalice must be given as a gift to the host (who cannot return it to the donor for any reason)."}</textarea>

"description":"When a priest enters othertime, he steps into a different reality in which the world around him is frozen at a moment in the future. Until time catches up to him, he may move about unhindered and observe his surroundings; no force known can detect his presence or harm him in the alternate reality, although he in turn cannot affect any creature or object in the physical world. For instance, he could read a book at the page it was opened to, but he could not turn the page since that would require him to move an object that is temporarily immovable for him. To his companions or enemy in real time, the priest appears to simply vanish altogether, only to reappear at some later point.
The duration of this spell is a little odd, to say the least. The priest may choose a duration of up to 1 round at 7th to 9th level, 2 rounds at 10th to 12th level, 3 rounds at 13th to 16th, 4 rounds at 17th to 19th, up to a maximum of 5 rounds at 20th level or higher. The duration chosen by the priest governs the length of the othertime; if the priest decides that the spell will last 2 rounds, then he is instantly transported to that point in time, surrounded by the frozen still-life of the world as it will appear 2 rounds after the priest cast othertime. The caster then has 2 rounds to himself to take any actions he cares to, although he cannot affect the real world by any physical, magical, or mental means.
While the caster is in the othertime, he is completely unaware of the intervening events. In the example above, if the caster's friends were teleported away 1 round after the caster left and replaced by an identical group of dopplegangers, the caster would have no chance to detect the switch; all he sees are the bodies of his \"friends,\" frozen in the positions they will occupy when he emerges from the othertime. This also means that nasty things like dragon breath, cloudkills, or mind blasts that pass through the spot where the caster happens to be have no effect on him-he simply does not exist in the real world while he waits for everyone else to catch up to him.
As noted above, the caster gains an amount of subjective time equal to the duration of the spell. By leaping 3 rounds into the future, the caster gains 3 rounds of actions in the othertime. He could drink a potion, cast a spell, and then maneuver for an attack, for example, or he could gain a 3-round head start by running for his life while no one else can pursue him. If the priest uses this time to study a battle and position himself for an attack, he gains a -4 bonus to his initiative roll on the round he emerges from othertime, and a +4 attack bonus with his first strike.
Leaping in and out of the time stream is a dangerous activity; every time the priest employs this spell, there is a 1% noncumulative chance that he becomes stuck in othertime, doomed to death by thirst or starvation when his own rations run out. Only the most extraordinary measures (a wish spell, divine intervention, etc.) can save a character in this predicament. Once a priest is in othertime, he cannot pray for further spells. After all, if the priest is going to attract his deity's attention by praying for spells, the deity will most likely allow him out! The material component for this spell is an hourglass filled with rare salts, worth at least 100 gold pieces."}</textarea>

However, if the person quested agrees to a task--even if the agreement is gained by force or trickery--no saving throw is allowed. If a quest is just and deserved, a creature of the priest's religion cannot avoid it, and any creature of the priest's alignment saves with a -4 penalty to the saving throw. A quest cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by a priest of the same religion or of higher level than the caster. Some artifacts and relics might negate the spell, as can direct intervention by a deity. Likewise, an unjust or undeserved quest grants bonuses to saving throws, or might even automatically fail.
The material component of this spell is the priest's holy symbol."}</textarea>

If a quest is just and deserved, a creature of the priest&#039;s religion cannot avoid it, and any creature of the priest&#039;s alignment saves with a -4 penalty to the saving throw. A quest cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by a priest of the same religion or of higher level than the caster. Some artifacts and relics might negate the spell, as can direct intervention by a deity. Likewise, an unjust or undeserved quest grants bonuses to saving throws, or might even automatically fail.<br />The material component of this spell is the priest&#039;s holy symbol.</div>

"description":"When the priest casts a raise dead spell, he can restore life to a dwarf, gnome, half-elf, halfling, or human (other creatures may be allowed, at the DM's option). The length of time that the person has been dead is of importance, as the priest can raise persons dead only up to a limit of one day for each experience level of the priest (i.e., a 9th-level priest can raise a person who has been dead for up to nine days).
Note that the body of the person must be whole, or otherwise missing parts are still missing when the person is brought back to life. Likewise, other ills, such as poison and disease, are not negated. The raised person must roll a successful resurrection survival check to survive the ordeal (see Table 3: Constitution) and loses 1 point of Constitution.
Further, the raised person is weak and helpless, needing a minimum of one full day of rest in bed for each day or fraction he was dead. The person has 1 hit point when raised and must regain the rest by natural healing or curative magic.
A character's starting Constitution is an absolute limit to the number of times he can be revived by this means.
The somatic component of the spell is a pointed finger.
The reverse of the spell, slay living, grants the victim a saving throw vs. death magic.
If the saving throw is successful, the victim sustains damage equal to that of a cause serious wounds spell--i.e., 2d8+1 points. Failure means the victim dies instantly."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell ages the targeted creature one year per level of the caster. Unwilling subjects may attempt a saving throw to resist the spell. Subjects affected by age creature must make a successful system shock roll to survive the change.
Subjects cannot be aged beyond their natural life spans. If the priest's level indicates that a creature would be aged beyond this level, the creature is aged to one year short of his maximum age. The spell cannot cause a subject to die.
Human and humanoid characters affected by the spell experience changes in appearance associated with increased age, such as gray hair and wrinkles. More significantly, they suffer losses in Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution when they reach certain age levels. These are summarized in Table 12: Aging Effects in the Player's Handbook. The Player's Handbook also provides rules for determining a character's base age.
Nonmagical monsters can be affected by age creature. The DM determines a monster's current age and natural life span based on its description in the MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM or based on his own judgment. To determine the effects of aging on a monster, assume the following: a monster is middle-aged when it reaches half its natural life span; a monster reaches old age at two-thirds of its natural life span; a monster reaches venerable age in the last one-sixth of its years. A monster suffers the penalties which follow when it reaches these age levels. The penalties are cumulative and permanent (unless the affected monster becomes younger).

The reverse of this spell, restore youth, permanently restores age that has been lost as a result of magic (such as an age creature spell). Restore youth reduces the age of the targeted creature by one year per level of the caster. The subject must make a successful system shock roll to survive the change. Subjects who become younger regain the lost ability scores described above. A subject cannot become younger than his actual age as a result of this spell.

				<div class="description-content">This spell ages the targeted creature one year per level of the caster. Unwilling subjects may attempt a saving throw to resist the spell. Subjects affected by age creature must make a successful system shock roll to survive the change.<br />Subjects cannot be aged beyond their natural life spans. If the priest&#039;s level indicates that a creature would be aged beyond this level, the creature is aged to one year short of his maximum age. The spell cannot cause a subject to die.<br />Human and humanoid characters affected by the spell experience changes in appearance associated with increased age, such as gray hair and wrinkles. More significantly, they suffer losses in Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution when they reach certain age levels. These are summarized in Table 12: Aging Effects in the Player&#039;s Handbook. The Player&#039;s Handbook also provides rules for determining a character&#039;s base age.<br />Nonmagical monsters can be affected by age creature. The DM determines a monster&#039;s current age and natural life span based on its description in the MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM or based on his own judgment. To determine the effects of aging on a monster, assume the following: a monster is middle-aged when it reaches half its natural life span; a monster reaches old age at two-thirds of its natural life span; a monster reaches venerable age in the last one-sixth of its years. A monster suffers the penalties which follow when it reaches these age levels. The penalties are cumulative and permanent (unless the affected monster becomes younger).<br />Age Penalty Middle Age -1 to all saving throws Old Age -1 to all saving throws -1 to all attack rolls Venerable -1 to all saving throws -1 to all attack rolls The material component is a pinch of powdered emerald.<br />The reverse of this spell, restore youth, permanently restores age that has been lost as a result of magic (such as an age creature spell).

"description":"This powerful spell enables the priest casting it to imbue inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of life. The animated object, or objects, then attacks whomever or whatever the priest first designates. The animated object can be of any nonmagical material whatsoever[md]wood, metal, stone, fabric, leather, ceramic, glass, etc.
Attempting to animate an object in someone's possession grants that person a saving throw to prevent the spell's effect. The speed of movement of the object depends on its means of propulsion and its weight. A large wooden table would be rather heavy, but its legs would give it speed. A rug could only slither along. A jar would roll. Thus a large stone pedestal would rock forward at 10 feet per round, a stone statue would move at 40 feet per round, a wooden statue 80 feet per round, an ivory stool of light weight would move at 120 feet per round. Slithering movement is about 10 feet to 20 feet per round; rolling is 30 feet to 60 feet per round. The damage caused by the attack of an animated object depends on its form and composition. Light, supple objects can only obscure vision, obstruct movement, bind, trip, smother, etc. Light, hard objects can fall upon or otherwise strike for 1d2 points of damage or possibly obstruct and trip, as do light, supple objects. Hard, medium-weight objects can crush or strike for 2d4 points of damage, while larger and heavier objects may inflict 3d4, 4d4, or even 5d4 points of damage.
The frequency of attack of animated objects depends on their method of locomotion, appendages, and method of attack. This varies from as seldom as once every five melee rounds to as frequently as once per round. The Armor Class of the object per round. The Armor Class of the object animated is basically a function of material and movement ability. Damage depends on the type of weapon is effective against fabric, leather, wood, and like substances. Heavy smashing and crushing weapons are useful against wood, stone, and metal objects. Your DM will determine all of these factors, as well as how much damage the animated object can sustain before being destroyed. The priest can animate one cubic foot of material for each experience level he has attained. Thus, a 14th-level priest could animate one or more objects whose solid volume did not exceed 14 cubic feet[md]a large statue, two rugs, three chairs, or a dozen average crocks."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell is similar to the 9th-level wizard spell time stop. When reverse time is cast, time stops within a 30-foot diameter of the subject. All creatures and items in the area of effect stand motionless, rivers stop running, and arrows hang suspended in the air. Any creature, person, or object entering the area of effect is likewise frozen in time. The caster is affected if he is within the area of effect, unless he is the subject of the spell.
An unwilling subject is allowed a saving throw vs. spell; if successful, the spell is immediately negated. Otherwise, the victim is forced to relive all the actions taken in the previous 1-4 rounds in reverse. Beginning with the most recent round, the subject moves backward, arrows fired by the subject return to his bow, and so on. All effects of these actions are negated. At the end of the spell's duration, normal time resumes and all creatures immediately continue their activities, picking up right where they had stopped.
Consider the following example. A party is battling a spellcasting red dragon. In the first round, the dragon breathes fire, roasting the party's wizard. The rest of the group attacks and injures the dragon. On the second round, the dragon bites and kills the group's thief. More damage is caused to the beast, but it is still alive in the third round, when it uses magic missile to kill the ranger. At this point, the priest casts reverse time on the beast. Fortunately, it fails its saving throw and is forced to reverse the last four rounds.
While everyone else freezes, the dragon goes into reverse. The magic missiles zoom back to the dragon (and it regains the ability to cast that spell), it \"unbites\" the thief (removing that damage from the character), and then inhales its fiery breath (leaving the roasted wizard alive and uncooked). The dragon is then reversed through one more round--the round before it encounterd the party. The spell then ends and actions resume.
The dragon must now roll for surprise since it is encountering the party for the first time. The party is immune to surprise, since it was fighting the beast previously. All damage suffered by the dragon remains, since these actions were caused by the group and not the beast.
The material component is an etched silver arrow bent into a circle. The arrow must be no more than 3 inches long and worth no less than 500 gp. The arrow is destroyed in the casting."}</textarea>

The magic missiles zoom back to the dragon (and it regains the ability to cast that spell), it &quot;unbites&quot; the thief (removing that damage from the character), and then inhales its fiery breath (leaving the roasted wizard alive and uncooked). The dragon is then reversed through one more round--the round before it encounterd the party. The spell then ends and actions resume.<br />The dragon must now roll for surprise since it is encountering the party for the first time. The party is immune to surprise, since it was fighting the beast previously. All damage suffered by the dragon remains, since these actions were caused by the group and not the beast.<br />The material component is an etched silver arrow bent into a circle. The arrow must be no more than 3 inches long and worth no less than 500 gp. The arrow is destroyed in the casting.</div>

"description":"By means of this spell, a priest is able to project his astral body into the Astral plane, leaving his physical body and material possessions behind on the Prime Material plane.
As the Astral plane touches upon the first levels of all the outer planes, the priest can travel astrally to the first level of any of these outer planes as he wills. The priest then leaves the Astral plane, forming a body on the plane of existence he has chosen to enter.
It is also possible to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime Material plane by means of the astral spell. However, a second body cannot be formed on the Prime Material plane.
As a general rule, a person astrally projected can be seen only by creatures on the Astral plane. The astral body is connected at all times to the material body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the affected person is killed, astrally and materially, but generally only the psychic wind can cause the cord to break. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body.
If the second body or astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to the caster's body where the body rests on the Prime Material plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.
The spell lasts until the priest desires to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic spell or destruction of the priest's body on the Prime Material plane--which kills the priest. The priest can project the astral forms of up to seven other creatures with himself by means of the astral spell, providing the creatures are linked in a circle with the priest. These fellow travelers are dependent upon the priest and can be stranded if something happens to the priest. Travel in the Astral plane can be slow or fast, according to the priest's desire. The ultimate destination arrived at is subject to the desire of the priest."}</textarea>

When a second body is formed on a different plane, the silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body.<br />If the second body or astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to the caster&#039;s body where the body rests on the Prime Material plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.<br />The spell lasts until the priest desires to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic spell or destruction of the priest&#039;s body on the Prime Material plane--which kills the priest. The priest can project the astral forms of up to seven other creatures with himself by means of the astral spell, providing the creatures are linked in a circle with the priest. These fellow travelers are dependent upon the priest and can be stranded if something happens to the priest. Travel in the Astral plane can be slow or fast, according to the priest&#039;s desire. The ultimate destination arrived at is subject to the desire of the priest.</div>

"description":"This powerful spell enables the caster to cure many persons (even an entire community) who are afflicted with a nonmagical disease. The priest need not touch or even see the diseased people for the spell to be effective, although recipients must be within the area of effect.
This spell does not cure all diseases in the community at one time; the caster must specifically state which disease is to be eliminated (black plague or yellow fever, for example) with each casting of the spell.
When the spell is cast, the priest exhales a sweet-smelling breath. This forms into a breeze that radiates outward, forming a circle that expands in a 50-yard radius per hour.
During this time, the caster must remain at the center of the area of effect. For example, after 12 hours, the breath of life would cover a circle 1200 yards in diameter (600-yard radius). The breath is of a magical nature rather than a physical nature; therefore, it is unaffected by prevailing winds.
The breeze blows through the community, instantly eliminating the specified disease from all afflicted citizens. The breath of life spell does not destroy parasitic monsters (such as green slime, rot grubs, and others), nor does it cure lycanthropy or other magical afflictions. The spell does not prevent recurrence of a disease if the recipients are again exposed.
The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a cone of incense that has been blessed by the highest priest of the character's religion.
The breath of death, which produces a foul-smelling wind, is the reverse of this spell.
Victims who fail a saving throw vs. death magic are afflicted with a nonmagical, fatal disease. To determine the results of this spell, the DM should roll saving throws for major NPCs in the area of effect. The effect on the rest of the community can be calculated as a percentage, based on the saving throw.
Infected creatures do not heal hit points until the disease is cured. The disease is fatal within 1d6 weeks (the duration varies from person to person).
The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a handful of dust taken from a mummy's corpse."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell causes confusion in one or more creatures within the area, creating indecision and the inability to take effective action. The spell affects 1d4 creatures, plus one creature per two caster levels. Thus, seven to ten creatures can be affected by a 12thor 13th-level caster, eight to 11 by a 14th- or 15th-level caster, etc. These creatures are allowed saving throws vs. spell with -2 penalties, adjusted for Wisdom. Those successfully saving are unaffected by the spell. Confused creatures react as follows (roll 1d10): d10 Reaction 1 Wander away (unless prevented) for duration of spell 2-6 Stand confused one round (then roll again) 7-9 Attack nearest creature for one round (then roll again) 10 Act normally for one round (then roll again) The spell lasts one round for each level of the caster. Those who fail their saving throws are checked by the DM for actions each round, for the duration of the spell, or until the \"wander away for the duration of the spell\" result occurs.
Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible in their most typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). This is not panicked flight.
Wandering creatures also have a 50% chance of using any special innate movement abilities (plane shift, burrowing, flight, etc.). Saving throws and actions are checked at the beginning of each round. Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature.
The material component of this spell is a set of three nut shells.
Note: If there are many creatures involved, the DM may decide to assume average results. For example, if there are 16 orcs affected and 25% could be expected to successfully roll the saving throw, then four are assumed to have succeeded, one wanders away, four attack the nearest creature, six stand confused and the last acts normally but must check next round. Since the orcs are not near the party, the DM decides that two who are supposed to attack the nearest creature attack each other, one attacks an orc that saved, and one attacks a confused orc, which strikes back. The next round, the base is 11 orcs, since four originally saved and one wandered off. Another one wanders off, five stands confused, four attack, and one acts normally."}</textarea>

"description":"When this spell is employed, the priest confronts some powerful creature from another plane (including devas and other powerful minions, for instance, but not demigods or deities of any sort) and requires of it some duty or quest. A creature of an alignment opposed to the priest (e.g., evil if the priest is good, chaotic if the priest is lawful) cannot be ordered around unless it is willing. Note that an absolute (true) neutral creature is effectively opposed to both good and evil, and both law and chaos.
The spellcaster must know something about the creature to exact service from it, or else he must offer some fair trade in return for the service. That is, if the priest is aware that the creature has received some favor from someone of the priest's alignment, then the exaction spell can name this as cause. If no balancing reason for service is known, then some valuable gift or service must be pledged in return for the exaction. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the past or promised favor or reward, and with the being's effort and risk. The spell then acts, subject to a magic resistance roll, as a quest upon the being that is to perform the required service. Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to the vicinity of the priest, and the priest must then and there return the promised reward, whether it is irrevocable cancellation of a past debt or the giving of some service or other material reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.
The DM adjudicates when an equitable arrangement has been reached. If the caster requests too much, the creature is free to depart or to attack the priest (as if the agreement were breached) according to its nature. If circumstances leave the situation unbalanced (for example, the creature dies while achieving a result that was not worth dying for), then this might create a debt owed by the caster to the creature's surviving kith and kin, making the caster vulnerable to a future exaction spell from that quarter. Agreeing to a future exaction or release in the event of catastrophic failure or death are common caster pledges in securing an exaction.
Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in the priest being subject to exaction by the subject creature or by its master, liege, etc., at the very least. At worst, the creature can attack the reneging priest without fear of any of his spells affecting it, for the priest's failure to live up to the bargain gives the creature immunity from the priest's spell powers.
The material components of this spell are the priest's holy symbol, some matter or substance from the plane of the creature from whom an exaction is expected, and knowledge of the creature's nature or actions that is written out on a parchment that is burned to seal the pledge."}</textarea>

Affected creatures are those within the 30-foot-radius area of effect, which is centered on the priest casting the spell. The side effects are negated for deafened or silenced creatures, but such are still driven off if other-planar.

"description":"The mind tracker is a magically-created creature which exists only on the Ethereal plane. It is called into existence when the first portion of this spell is cast.
When seen (which is seldom), the mind tracker has an indistinct body. It seems to be a near-solid coalescence of the vaporous atmosphere of the Ethereal plane itself. It is a roughly elliptical body with three or more limbs protruding at seemingly random locations. The number and size of these appendages shifts slowly, however, as new ones appear from the mist and old ones disappear. The body of the creature averages 2 feet across and 3 feet long, though this, too, tends to vary from minute to minute. The mind tracker has no discernible eyes, ears, nose, or other organs. It cannot be engaged in combat; if attacked, it simply disappears, to reappear after the danger has passed, or somewhere else entirely if its quarry has moved on.
The ceremony which creates the mind tracker takes one turn to perform. Its material components are a whiff of the Ethereal plane's atmosphere and the brain of a lizard.
Once the tracker is manifested, it must be assigned a quarry within one hour. If no quarry is designated, the tracker dissipates and the spell is wasted.
To assign a quarry to the tracker, the priest must have the quarry within his sight. This includes magical sight such as true seeing, but not remote sighting devices such as crystal balls. With the quarry in sight, the priest mouths the final phrases of the spell. From that point on, the mind tracker is mentally tethered to the victim. It follows its quarry (staying always in the Ethereal plane) wherever it goes. It constantly relays information about the subject to the priest: what it is doing, where it is. The priest does not actually see an image of the quarry, he receives `reports' from the mind tracker. These reports contain only such information as the tracker can gather by looking. It cannot identify people the quarry is talking to, but can describe them in great detail. Nor can it hear anything the quarry or anyone else says, or read writing, but it recognizes and can report the fact that speaking or reading is happening.
While the tracker is dogging its quarry, its presence can be felt as an eery, creepy sensation of being watched. If the victim makes an initial save vs. paralyzation, each of the following stages lasts three hours instead of two. For the first two hours, the quarry has a general feeling of ill ease. In the third and fourth hours, the victim is distracted and nervous, and suffers a -1 penalty on all saving throws. In the fifth and sixth hours, the victim is convinced someone or something is following him and suffers a -3 penalty on saving throws and a -2 (or -10%) penalty on all other dice rolls. After six hours the victim is near his breaking point. He is unable to concentrate to cast spells or use any of his class's special abilities. All die rolls have a -5 (or -25%) penalty. After eight hours, he must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation. If he fails, he collapses, fevered and delirious.
This state persists until the tracker ceases to exist.
The mind tracker continues to exist for as long as the priest remains conscious of its input. If the priest is knocked out or falls asleep, or simply dismisses his creation, the tracker dissipates."}</textarea>

"description":"This cooperative spell is rarely used or spoken of, since its requirements are strict and the outcome is uncertain. The spell must be cast by six priests of the same faith. All six must touch hands at the time of casting. At the completion of the spell, the priests fall into a trance. The life essences of the priests leave their bodies and merge at a point within 10 feet of the casters. The spirits of the priests meld together to form the avatar of the priests' deity.
In this manner, the six characters become a single being with all the powers and abilities allowed to that avatar. The only stipulation is that the priests' deity cannot have created all avatars allowed to it at that moment. If this has happened, the spell fails and the priests are drained as described below.
If the spell succeeds, the priests have completely given their wills over to their deity, essentially forming the vessel into which it funnels power. In becoming the avatar, the priests retain the ability to make most of their own decisions. (The six must work in harmony or allow one of their number to decide all actions.) However, the deity can assume direct control of the avatar at any time it desires--the avatar is, after all, an earthly manifestation of the deity.
Although the spell has a duration of one hour, the deity is not obliged to release the priests at that time. If the priests are not released at the end of the spell's duration, they instantly die. A deity can choose to sacrifice its priests in order to maintain its avatar on the Prime Material plane. Such a cruel and unjust action is almost never undertaken by good deities or those that have any respect for life, free will, or mercy. For dark and sinister gods, the question is much more uncertain. If a deity chooses to maintain the avatar longer than one hour, control of the avatar instantly and permanently passes to the DM. (Clearly, a DM should seldom if ever exercise this power.) While the priests are formed into the avatar, their bodies remain in a death like trance.
The priests have no idea what might be happening to their real bodies (unless the avatar can observe them). Any damage to a priest's body requires an instant system shock roll. If successful, the damage is recorded normally, but the damage does not take effect until the spell ends (at which point the priest will almost certainly die). If the system shock roll is failed, the character instantly dies and the spell ends. Characters who die in this manner cannot be raised, resurrected, or reincarnated. They have been taken to the ultimate reward (or punishment) for the service they have rendered. If the bodies are moved from their positions, the spell ends.
Even if the deity releases the priests, they are left severely drained. All spells memorized are lost until the priest can rest and perform his prayers once again. The physical drain leaves each priest with only 1 hit point upon awakening, regardless of the number of hit points the character had when the spell was cast. Since damage suffered during the spell takes effect instantly, any priest who is hurt dies immediately (although quick action by others might save him).
Each priest who survives the spell will be bound by a quest (a duty that must be completed in exchange for calling upon their god).
The material component is an offering appropriate to the deity. The DM determines the exact nature of this offering."}</textarea>

"description":"By casting this spell, the priest creates a powerful magic aura in some specially prepared object--a string of prayer beads, a small clay tablet, an ivory baton, etc. This object radiates magic, for it contains the power to instantaneously transport its possessor to the sanctuary of the priest who created its magic. Once the item is enchanted, the priest must give it willingly to an individual, at the same time informing him of a command word to be spoken when the item is to be used. To make use of the item, the recipient must speak the command word at the same time that he rends or breaks the item. When this is done, the individual and all that he is wearing and carrying (up to the maximum encumbrance limit for the character) are instantly transported to the sanctuary of the priest, just as if the individual were capable of speaking a word of recall spell. No other creatures can be affected.
The reversed application of the spell causes the priest to be transported to the immediate vicinity of the possessor of the item when it is broken and the command word said. The priest has a general idea of the location and situation of the item's possessor, and can choose not to be affected by this summons. This decision is made at the instant when the transportation is to take place. However, if he chooses not to go, the opportunity is gone forever and the spell is wasted.
The cost of preparing the special item (for either version of the spell) varies from 2,000 to 5,000 gp. The more costly items can transport the subject from one plane of existence to another, if the DM allows. Note that the same factors that can prevent the operation of the plane shift and teleport spells can also prevent the use of this spell."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">By casting this spell, the priest creates a powerful magic aura in some specially prepared object--a string of prayer beads, a small clay tablet, an ivory baton, etc. This object radiates magic, for it contains the power to instantaneously transport its possessor to the sanctuary of the priest who created its magic. Once the item is enchanted, the priest must give it willingly to an individual, at the same time informing him of a command word to be spoken when the item is to be used. To make use of the item, the recipient must speak the command word at the same time that he rends or breaks the item. When this is done, the individual and all that he is wearing and carrying (up to the maximum encumbrance limit for the character) are instantly transported to the sanctuary of the priest, just as if the individual were capable of speaking a word of recall spell. No other creatures can be affected.<br />The reversed application of the spell causes the priest to be transported to the immediate vicinity of the possessor of the item when it is broken and the command word said. The priest has a general idea of the location and situation of the item&#039;s possessor, and can choose not to be affected by this summons. This decision is made at the instant when the transportation is to take place. However, if he chooses not to go, the opportunity is gone forever and the spell is wasted.<br />The cost of preparing the special item (for either version of the spell) varies from 2,000 to 5,000 gp. The more costly items can transport the subject from one plane of existence to another, if the DM allows. Note that the same factors that can prevent the operation of the plane shift and teleport spells can also prevent the use of this spell.</div>
