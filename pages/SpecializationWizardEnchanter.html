"description":"When the audible glamer spell is cast, the wizard causes a volume of sound to arise, at whatever distance he desires (within range), and seem to recede, approach, or remain at a fixed place as desired. The volume of sound created, however, is directly related to the level of the spellcaster. 

The volume is based upon the lowest level at which the spell can be cast, 1st level. The noise of the audible glamer at this level is that of four men, maximum. Each additional experience level of the wizard adds a like volume, so that at 2nd level the wizard can have the spell cause sound equal to that of eight men. Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The auditory illusion created by an audible glamer spell can be virtually any type of sound, but the relative volume must be commensurate with the level of the wizard casting the spell. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight men running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise volume of 16 men, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise volume of no fewer than 24 men.

A character stating that he does not believe the sound receives a saving throw, and if it succeeds, the character then hears a faint and obviously false sound, emanating from the caster's direction. 

Note that this spell can enhance the effectiveness of the phantasmal force spell.

The material component of the spell is a bit of wool or a small lump of wax."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">When the audible glamer spell is cast, the wizard causes a volume of sound to arise, at whatever distance he desires (within range), and seem to recede, approach, or remain at a fixed place as desired. The volume of sound created, however, is directly related to the level of the spellcaster. <br /><br />The volume is based upon the lowest level at which the spell can be cast, 1st level. The noise of the audible glamer at this level is that of four men, maximum. Each additional experience level of the wizard adds a like volume, so that at 2nd level the wizard can have the spell cause sound equal to that of eight men. Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The auditory illusion created by an audible glamer spell can be virtually any type of sound, but the relative volume must be commensurate with the level of the wizard casting the spell. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight men running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise volume of 16 men, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise volume of no fewer than 24 men.<br /><br />A character stating that he does not believe the sound receives a saving throw, and if it succeeds, the character then hears a faint and obviously false sound, emanating from the caster&#039;s direction. <br /><br />Note that this spell can enhance the effectiveness of the phantasmal force spell.<br /><br />The material component of the spell is a bit of wool or a small lump of wax.</div>

The cantrip spell is a practice method for the apprentice, teaching him how to tap minute amounts of magical energy. Once cast, the cantrip spell enables the caster to create minor magical effects for the duration of the spell. 

So minor are these effects that they have severe limitations. They are completely unable to cause a loss of hit points, cannot affect the concentration of spellcasters, and can only create small, obviously magical materials. Furthermore, materials created by a cantrip are extremely fragile and cannot be used as tools of any sort. Lastly, a cantrip lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. 
Whatever manifestation the cantrip takes, it remains in effect only as long as the wizard concentrates. Wizards typically use cantrips to impress common folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives. 

Common tricks with cantrips include tinklings of ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, glowing balls that float over the caster's hand, puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of bland food, and little whirlwinds to sweep dust under rugs. Combined with the unseen servant spell, these are the tools to make housekeeping and entertaining simpler for the wizard."}</textarea>

The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not.
The person receives a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect, with any adjustment due to Wisdom (see Table 5). If the person receives damage from the caster group in the same round the charm is cast an additional bonus of +1 per hit point of damage received is added to the victim's saving throw.
If the spell recipient fails his saving throw, he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton, but any word or action of the caster is viewed in the most favorable way. 
Thus, a charmed person would not obey suicide command, but he might believe the caster if assured that the only chance to save the caster's life is for the person to hold back an on rushing red dragon for \"just a round or two.\" Note also that the spell does not endow the caster with linguistic capabilities beyond those he normally possesses (i.e., he must speak the victim's language to communicate his commands).
The duration of the spell is a function of the charmed person's Intelligence and is tied to the saving throw. The spell may be broken if a successful saving throw is rolled, and this saving throw is checked on a periodic basis, according to the creature's Intelligence (see the following table). If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed person by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed person, the charm spell is broken.
If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the result is decided by the DM. This could range from one effect being clearly dominant, to the subject being torn by conflicting desires, to new saving throws that could negate both spells.
Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he was charmed.

Time Between Checks for Intelligence Score of 3 or less: 3 months
Time Between Checks for Intelligence Score of 4 to 6: 2 months
Time Between Checks for Intelligence Score of 7 to 9: 1 month
Time Between Checks for Intelligence Score of 10 to 12: 3 weeks

Only passages, doors, or openings that have been deliberately constructed so as to escape detection are detected by this spell- a trap door buried beneath crates in a cellar, an illusionary wall, or an amulet left in a cluttered room would not be detected. The wizard affects an area of 10 feet square per level, so a 4th-level wizard could search four sections of wall, floor, or ceiling. Any doorways or openings detected by this spell glow softly for one full turn. It's possible that a wizard might not find a secret compartment in the area of effect if the compartment is behind or under another object that covers it completely. This spell only detects the doorway or opening; the wizard may have to search for a mechanism or catch that opens the door."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">This spell enables a wizard to detect secret doors, compartments, caches, and similar devices. Only passages, doors, or openings that have been deliberately constructed so as to escape detection are detected by this spell- a trap door buried beneath crates in a cellar, an illusionary wall, or an amulet left in a cluttered room would not be detected. The wizard affects an area of 10 feet square per level, so a 4th-level wizard could search four sections of wall, floor, or ceiling. Any doorways or openings detected by this spell glow softly for one full turn. It&#039;s possible that a wizard might not find a secret compartment in the area of effect if the compartment is behind or under another object that covers it completely. This spell only detects the doorway or opening; the wizard may have to search for a mechanism or catch that opens the door.</div>

"description":"This spell causes instant growth of a creature or object, increasing both size and weight. It can be cast only upon a single creature (or a symbiotic or community entity) or upon a single object that does not exceed ten cubic feet in volume per caster level. The object or creature must be seen to be affected.
 
It grows by up to 10% per level of experience of the wizard, increasing this amount in height, width, and weight. Magical properties are not increased by this spell - a huge sword +1 is still only +1, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions, a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate, etc. Weight, mass and strength are affected, though. Thus, a table blocking a door would be heavier and more effective, a hurled stein would have more mass (and cause more damage), chains would be more massive, doors thicker, a thin line turned to a sizeable, longer rope, and so on. A creature's hit points, Armor Class, and attack rolls do not change, but damage rolls increase proportionally with size. 

For example, a fighter at 160% normal size hits with his long sword and rolls a 6 for damage. The adjusted damage roll is 10 (that is 6 x 1.6 = 9.6, rounded up). Bonuses due to Strength, class, and magic are not altered.

The reverse spell, reduce, negates the enlarge spell or makes creatures or objects smaller. The creature or object loses 10% of its original size for every level of the caster, to a minimum of 10% of the original size. Thereafter, the size shrinks by one-foot increments to less than one foot, by one-inch increments to one inch, and by 1/10-inch increments to a minimum of 1/10 of an inch - the recipient cannot dwindle away to nothingness.

For example, a 16-foot-tall giant reduced by a 15th-level wizard (15 steps) would be reduced to 1.6 feet (in nine steps), then to 6/10 of a foot or 7.2 inches (in one step), and finally to 2.2 inches (in the last five steps). A shrinking object may damage weaker materials affixed to it, but an object will shrink only as long as the object itself is not damaged. Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell.

The material component of this spell is a pinch of powdered iron."}</textarea>

"description":"When this spell is cast, the creature(s) or object(s) affected immediately assumes the mass of a piece of down. Rate of falling is instantly changed to a mere two feet per second (120 feet per round), and no damage is incurred upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration ceases, normal rate of fall occurs.
 
The spell can be cast upon the wizard or some other creature or object up to the maximum range and lasts for one round for each level of the wizard. The feather fall affects one or more objects or creatures in a 10-foot cube, as long as the maximum weight of the creatures or objects does not exceed a combined total of 200 pounds plus 200 pounds per level of the spellcaster. 

For example, a 2nd-level wizard has a range of 20 yards, a duration of two rounds, and a weight limit of 600 pounds when casting this spell. 

The spell works only upon free-falling, flying, or propelled objects (such as missiles). It does not affect a sword blow or a charging creature. 

Note that the spell can be effectively combined with gust of wind and similar spells."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">When this spell is cast, the creature(s) or object(s) affected immediately assumes the mass of a piece of down. Rate of falling is instantly changed to a mere two feet per second (120 feet per round), and no damage is incurred upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration ceases, normal rate of fall occurs.<br /> <br />The spell can be cast upon the wizard or some other creature or object up to the maximum range and lasts for one round for each level of the wizard. The feather fall affects one or more objects or creatures in a 10-foot cube, as long as the maximum weight of the creatures or objects does not exceed a combined total of 200 pounds plus 200 pounds per level of the spellcaster. <br /><br />For example, a 2nd-level wizard has a range of 20 yards, a duration of two rounds, and a weight limit of 600 pounds when casting this spell. <br /><br />The spell works only upon free-falling, flying, or propelled objects (such as missiles). It does not affect a sword blow or a charging creature. <br /><br />Note that the spell can be effectively combined with gust of wind and similar spells.</div>

"description":"This spell enables the caster to attempt to summon a familiar to act as his aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures, such as cats, frogs, ferrets, crows, hawks, snakes, owls, ravens, toads, weasels, or even mice. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with him, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well. A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, however he has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any at all come. 

The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically 2 or 3 Int points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The wizard receives the heightened senses of his familiar, which grants the wizard a +1 bonus to all surprise die rolls. Normal familiars have 2-4 hit points plus 1 hit point per caster level, and an Armor Class of 7 (due to size, speed, etc.).

The wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands at a distance of up to one mile. Note that empathic responses from the familiar are generally fairly basic - while able to communicate simple thoughts, these are often overwhelmed by instinctual responses. Thus a ferret familiar spying on a band of orcs in the woods might lose its train of thought upon sighting a mouse. Certainly its communications to its master would be tinged with fear of the \"big ones\" it was spying on! The caster cannot see through the familiar's eyes.

If separated from the caster, the familiar loses 1 hit point each day, and dies if reduced to 0 hit points. When the familiar is in physical contact with its wizard, it gains the wizards saving throws against special attacks. If a special attack would normally cause damage, the familiar suffers no damage if the saving throw is successful and half damage if the saving throw is failed. 

If the familiar dies, the wizard must successfully roll an immediate system shock check or die. Even if he survives this check, the wizard loses 1 point from his Constitution when the familiar dies.

The power of the conjuration is such that it can be attempted but once per year. When the wizard decides to find a familiar, he must load a brass brazier with charcoal. When this is burning well, he adds 1.000 gp worth of incense and herbs. The spell incantation is then begun and must be continued until the familiar comes or the casting time is finished. The DM secretly determines all results. Note that most familiars are not inherently magical, nor does a dispel magic spell send them away.

Deliberate mistreatment, failure to feed and care for the familiar, or continuous unreasonable demands have adverse effects on the familiar's relationship with its master. Purposely arranging the death of one's own familiar incurs great disfavor from certain powerful entities, with dire results.

On a d20 roll of 1-5 a black Cat is summoned, granting excellent night vision & superior hearing
On a d20 roll of 6-7 a Crow is summoned, granting excellent vision
On a d20 roll of 8-9 a Hawk is summoned, granting very superior distance vision
On a d20 roll of 10-11 a Owl is summoned, granting night vision equal to human daylight vision and superior hearing
On a d20 roll of 12-13 a Toad is summoned, granting wide-angle vision
On a d20 roll of 14-15 a Weasel is summoned, granting superior hearing & very superior olfactory power
On a d20 roll of 16-20 no familiar is available within spell range

The referee can substitute other small animals suitable to the area."}</textarea>

"description":"When an identify spell is cast, magical items subsequently touched by the wizard can be identified. The eight hours immediately preceeding the casting of the spell must be spent purifying the items and removing influences that would corrupt and blur their magical auras. If this period is interrupted, it must be begun again. When the spell is cast, each item must be handled in turn by the wizard. Any consequences of this handling fall fully upon the wizard and may end the spell, although the wizard is allowed any applicable saving throw.

The chance of learning a piece of information about an item is equal to 10% per level of the caster, to a maximum of 90%, rolled by the DM. Any roll of 96-00 indicates a false reading (91-95 reveal nothing). Only one function of a multi-function item is discovered per handling (i.e., a 5-th level wizard could attempt to determine the nature of five different items, five different functions of a single item, or any combination of the two). If any attempt at reading fails, the caster cannot learn any more about that item until he advances a level. Note that some items, such as special magical tomes, cannot be identified with this spell.

The item never reveals its exact attack or damage bonuses, although the fact that it has few or many bonuses can be determined. If it has charges, only a general indication of the number of charges remaining is learned: powerful (81% - 100% of the total possible charges), strong (61% - 80%), moderate (41% - 60%), weak (6% - 40%), or faint (five charges or less). The faint result takes precedence, so a fully charges ring of three wishes always appears to be only faintly charged.

After casting the spell and determining what can be learned from it, the wizard loses 8 points of Constitution. He must rest for one hour to recover each point of Constitution. If the 8-point loss drops the spellcaster below a Constitution of 1, he falls unconscious. Consciousness is not regained until full Constitution is restored, which takes 24 hours (one point per three hours for an unconscious character).

The material components of this spell are a pearl (of at least 100gp value) and an owl feather steeped in wine, with the infusion drunk prior to spellcasting. If a luckstone is powdered and added to the infusion, the divination becomes much more potent: exact bonuses or charges can be determined, and the functions of a multi-functional item can be learned from a single reading.

At the DM's option, certain properties of an artifact or relic might also be learned."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell transmutes one type of liquid into an equal amount of a different, nonmagical fluid (water, wine, blood, oil, apple cider, etc.). The caster must touch the fluid itself (not simply its container) for the spell to take effect.

Magical liquids (such as potions) receive a saving throw vs. disintegration with a +3 bonus to avoid the spell's effect. Fluids can be transmuted only into nonmagical liquids; it is not possible to change a magical liquid into another type of magical liquid. Poisons may be rendered harmless through use of this spell, but the spell has no effect on poisons already consumed.

Living creatures are unaffected by the spell, excluding those from the elemental plane of water. Such creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell. Failure results in ld4 points of damage per level of the caster, while success indicates half damage. Only one creature can be affected by a single casting of this spell, regardless of the creature's size.

Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by creatures of an extraplanar or conjured nature. This cause the natural weapon attacks require touching the protected being. Animals or monsters summoned or conjured by spells or similar magic are likewise hedged from the character.

Any attacks that require physical contact(bites, stings, claws, etc.) Automatically fail, but a creature with a ranged attack can still attack the spell&#039;s recipient.<br /><br />The spell ends if the recipient attacks a creature he has been protected against, or tries to pin or trap the vermin by forcing the repelling barrier against them. The material component for this spell is a cone of pungent incense burned in a tiny bronze censer containing osquip ashes. </div>

All creatures to be affected by the sleep spell must be within 30 feet of each other. The number of creatures that can be affected is a function of Hit Dice or levels. 

The spell affects 2d4 Hit Dice of monsters. Monsters with 4+3 Hit Dice (4 Hit Dice plus 3 hit points) or more are unaffected. The center of the area of effect is determined by the spellcaster. The creatures with the least Hit Dice are affected first, and partial effects are ignored.

For example, a wizard casts sleep at three kobolds, two gnolls, and an ogre. The roll (2d4) result is 4. All the kobolds and one gnoll are affected (1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 2 = 3 1/2 Hit Dice). 

Note that the remainder is not enough to affect the last gnoll or the ogre.

Slapping or wounding awakens affected creatures but normal noise does not. Awakening requires one entire round. Magically sleeping opponents can be attacked with substantial bonuses (see Combat, page 90).

This includes sheer surfaces, over hangs, spider webs, etc. To fully gain these powers, the creature must be barefoot, as the spell only affects the creature&#039;s body and not their gear.<br /><br />Because the creature&#039;s hands are sticky, objects of 1lb or less cannot be manipulated. Casters may have a hard time with spells that require material components (being unable to cast with components that weigh a pound or less). Similarly, trying to remove a creature enchanted thusly from a wall (pull or knock off) requires a strength check.</div>

"description":"A spook spell enables the wizard to play upon natural fears to cause the target creature to perceive the spellcaster as someone or something inimical. Without actually knowing what this is, the wizard merely advances threateningly upon the creature. If a successful saving throw vs. spell is not made, the creature turns and flees at maximum speed as far from the wizard as possible, though items carried are not dropped. The creature has a saving throw penalty of -1 for every two experience levels of the caster, to a maximum of -6 at 12th level. 

Note that a natural (unmodified) roll of 20 automatically succeeds, regardless of saving throw penalties. Although the caster does not actually pursue the fleeing creature, a phantasm from its own mind does. Each round after the initial casting, the creature receives another saving throw, without penalty, until it successfully saves and the spell is broken. 

In any event, the spell functions only against creatures with Intelligences of 2 or more, and undead are not affected at all.

As with the light spell, it can be cast into the air, onto an object, or at a creature.

A continual light brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. A direct casting of continual light against a similar or weaker magical darkness cancels both.

"description":"This spell enables the wizard to specially prepare a garment so as to hold far more than it normally could. A finely sewn gown or robe of high quality material (at least 50gp value) is fashioned so as to contain numerous hand-sized pockets. One dozen is the minimum number. 

The deeppockets spell then enables these pockets to hold a total of 100 pounds (five cubic feet in volume) as if it were only 10 pounds of weight. Furthermore, there are no discernible bulges where the special pockets are. At the time of casting, the caster can instead chose to have 10 pockets each holding 10 pounds (1/2 cubic foot volume each). 

If the robe or like garment is sewn with 100 or more pockets (200gp minimum cost), 100 pockets can be created to contain one pound of weight and 1/6 cubic foot volume each. Each special pocket is actually an extradimensional holding space.

If the spell duration expires while there is material within the enchanted pockets, or if a successful dispel magic is cast upon the enchanted garment, all the material suddenly appears around the wearer and immediately falls to the ground. The caster can also cause all the pockets to empty with a single command.

In addition to the garment, which is reusable, the material components of this spell are a tiny golden needle and a strip of fine cloth given a half-twist and fastened at the ends.

"description":"The fog cloud spell can be cast in one of two ways, at the caster's option: as a large, stationary bank of normal fog, or as a harmless fog that resembles the 5th-level wizard spell cloudkill.

As a fog bank, this spell creates a fog of any size and shape up to a maximum 20-foot cube per caster level. The fog obscures all sight, normal and infravision, beyond two feet.

As a cloudkill-like fog, this is a billowing mass of ghastly, yellowish-green vapors, measuring 40 feet x 20 feet x 20 feet. This moves away from the caster at 10 feet per round. The vapors are heavier than air and sink to the lowest level, even pouring down sinkholes and den openings. Very thick vegetation breaks up the fog after it has moved 20 feet into the vegetation.

The only effect of either version is to obscure vision. 

A strong breeze will disperse either effect in one round, while a moderate breeze will reduce the spell duration by 50%.

"description":"Copper coins can temporarily be changed to gold pieces, or brass items turned to solid gold, for the spell duration by means of this magic. The area of effect is ten cubic inches per level - i.e., a 1\" x 1\" x 10\" volume or equivalent, equal to about 150gold coins. 
Any creature viewing the \"gold\" is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell, which can be modified by the creature's Wisdom; for every level of the wizard, the creature must subtract 1 from his dice roll. Thus it is unlikely that fools' gold will be detected if it was created by a high-level caster. 

If the \"gold\" is struck hard by an object of cold-wrought iron, there is a slight chance it will revert to its natural state, depending on the material component used to create the - \"gold.\"

If a 25-gp citrine is powdered and sprinkled over the metal as this spell is cast, the chance that cold iron will return it to its true nature is 30%; 
if a 50-gp amber stone is powdered and used, there is a 25% chance that iron will dispel the magic; 
if a 250-gp topaz is powdered, the chance drops to 10%;
if a 500-gp oriental (corundum) topaz is powdered, there is only a 1% chance that the cold iron will reveal that it is fools' gold."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">Copper coins can temporarily be changed to gold pieces, or brass items turned to solid gold, for the spell duration by means of this magic. The area of effect is ten cubic inches per level - i.e., a 1&quot; x 1&quot; x 10&quot; volume or equivalent, equal to about 150gold coins. <br />Any creature viewing the &quot;gold&quot; is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell, which can be modified by the creature&#039;s Wisdom; for every level of the wizard, the creature must subtract 1 from his dice roll. Thus it is unlikely that fools&#039; gold will be detected if it was created by a high-level caster. <br /><br />If the &quot;gold&quot; is struck hard by an object of cold-wrought iron, there is a slight chance it will revert to its natural state, depending on the material component used to create the - &quot;gold.&quot;<br /><br />If a 25-gp citrine is powdered and sprinkled over the metal as this spell is cast, the chance that cold iron will return it to its true nature is 30%; <br />if a 50-gp amber stone is powdered and used, there is a 25% chance that iron will dispel the magic; <br />if a 250-gp topaz is powdered, the chance drops to 10%;<br />if a 500-gp oriental (corundum) topaz is powdered, there is only a 1% chance that the cold iron will reveal that it is fools&#039; gold.</div>

Itching. When cast, this causes each subject to feel an instant itching sensation on some portion of its body.

Rash. When a rash is cast, the subject notices nothing for 1d4 rounds, but thereafter its entire skin breaks out in red welts that itch. The rash persists until either a cure disease or dispel magic spell is cast upon it. It lowers Charisma by 1 point per day for each of four days (i.e., maximum Charisma loss is 4 points).

"description":"The knock spell opens stuck, barred, locked, held, or wizard-locked doors. It opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains. 

If used to open a wizard-locked door, the spell does not remove the former spell, but simply suspends its functioning for one turn. In all other cases, it permanently opens locks or welds - although the former could be closed and locked again later. It does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. 

Note that the effect is limited by the area; a 3rd-level wizard can cast a knock spell on a door of 30 square feet or less (for example, a standard 4-ft. x 7-ft. door). 

Each spell can undo up to two means of preventing egress through a portal. Thus if a door is locked, barred, and held, or triple locked, opening it requires two knock spells. In all cases, the location of the door or item must be known - the spell cannot be used against a wall in hopes of discovering a secret door.

The reverse spell, lock, closes and locks a door or similar closure, provided there is a physical mechanism. It does not create a weld, but it locks physically operated locking mechanisms, set bars, and so on, up to two functions. It cannot affect a portcullis."}</textarea>

"description":"When a levitate spell is cast, the wizard can place it upon his person, upon an object, or upon a single creature, subject to a maximum weight limit of 100 pounds per level of experience (e.g., a 3rd-level wizard can levitate up to 300 pounds maximum). If the spell is cast upon the wizard, he can move vertically up or down at a movement rate of 2 per round. If cast upon an object or another creature, the wizard can levitate it at the same speed according to his command. 

Horizontal movement is not empowered by this spell, but the recipient could push along the face of a cliff, for example, to move laterally. 

The spellcaster can cancel the spell as desired. If the subject of the spell is unwilling, or the object is in the possession of a creature, a saving throw vs. spell is allowed to determine if the levitate spell affects it.

Once cast, the spell requires no concentration, except when changing height. A levitating creature attempting to use a missile weapon finds himself increasingly unstable; the first attack has an attack roll penalty of -1, the second -2, and the third -3, etc., up to a maximum of -5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at -1. Lack of leverage makes it impossible to cock a medium or heavy crossbow.

Landmarks must be stationary and singular. Should a stationary landmark be moved, perhaps the \"Great Tree of Vitality\" has been cut down and moved, the original location of the landmark as it is known to people in the range of the spell is used. Mobile landmarks, like a King's Crown, automatically fail.

Example: Bobo the diviner casts Locate Landmark, with the landmark in question being the secret burial ground of elves. Bobo is in a human dominated region, where nobody knows the answer to this question, so it returns no answer. Bobo then decides to head to a major port where there are many elves, and casts the spell again. The compass in his hand turns to point North West. Bobo doesn't know how far North West it is, so he travels North West for six days before casting the spell again. This time he is in a small elvan port town that allows human visitors. He casts the spell again, and gets a direction of south west. Bobo knows he's overshot the distance, and can change directions, heading south this time.

A very careful wizard with a compass and map might be able to triangulate the location of a landmark, although this can be tricky since the further the target is from the landmark, the more the compass needle wobbles. "}</textarea>

"description":"The caster creates a circle on a stable surface with chalk and powered silver or lead. The size of the circle dictates how much chalk, silver, and lead is needed, as well as the casting time. Each foot of diameter consumes 30cp worth of lead or 60cp worth of silver and takes 2 minutes to create. Once the circle is created, the spell takes 1 minute to cast.

Once the circle is drawn and the spell is cast, nothing (physical or magical) may cross the boundary within the circle. If the chalk and powder circle is broken (a hair or straw laying across it, or being scuffed, for example), the spell is instantly broken. Items or creatures may be summoned within the circle, preventing them from running free, but also preventing the caster, or others, from interacting with the creature. While touch and spells may not cross the border, non-magical sounds may.

A creature inside the circle may attempt to break out. To do so, the creature rolls a d10 and adds their willpower and their number of hit dice. The spellcaster rolls the same thing. If the creature's roll equals or beats the caster's, the creature breaks free of the circle. If the circle is made with silver, instead of lead, the caster has advantage on the d10 roll. When this spell is broken in this way, there is a short but blinding flash of light outside the circle.

This circle may be reused over and over, as long as it is not disturbed. A permanent magic circle can be made at 100x the cost. The permanent version of this circle uses inlaid stones and molten metals.

The spell, but not the physical circle, may be dispelled by the original caster with a touch."}</textarea>

While touch and spells may not cross the border, non-magical sounds may.<br /><br />A creature inside the circle may attempt to break out. To do so, the creature rolls a d10 and adds their willpower and their number of hit dice. The spellcaster rolls the same thing. If the creature&#039;s roll equals or beats the caster&#039;s, the creature breaks free of the circle. If the circle is made with silver, instead of lead, the caster has advantage on the d10 roll. When this spell is broken in this way, there is a short but blinding flash of light outside the circle.<br /><br />This circle may be reused over and over, as long as it is not disturbed. A permanent magic circle can be made at 100x the cost. The permanent version of this circle uses inlaid stones and molten metals.<br /><br />The spell, but not the physical circle, may be dispelled by the original caster with a touch.</div>

"description":"When this spell is cast, the wizard imbues the chosen object with an enchanted mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message when a specified event occurs. The message, which must be of 25 words or less, can be in any language known by the spellcaster, and can be delivered over a period of one turn. 

The mouth cannot speak magical spells or use command words. It does, however, move to the words articulated - if it is placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would actually move and appear to speak. Of course, the magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, door, or any other object, excluding intelligent members of the animal or vegetable kingdoms. 

The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled, according to the command of the spellcaster. 

Some examples are to speak \"to the first creature that touches you,\" or \"to the first creature that passes within 30 feet.\" Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used, such as the following: \"Speak only when a venerable female human carrying a sack of groat clusters sits crosslegged within 1 foot.\" Such visual triggers can react to a character using the disguise ability. Command range is 5 yards per level of the wizard, so a 6th-level wizard can command the magic mouth to speak at a maximum encounter range of 30 yards (\"Speak when a winged creature comes within 30 yards.\"). 

The spell lasts until the speak command can be fulfilled; thus, the spell duration is variable. A magic mouth cannot distinguish invisible creatures, alignments, level, Hit Dice, or class, except by external garb. If desired, the effect can be keyed to a specific noise or spoken word.

"description":"The caster eats a feather and then whispers the words to the spell, summoning a small bird into existence. The bird will flutter about in front of the caster for 1 minute while the caster delivers a short message to it, as well as a verbal and mental picture of the person to whom the message ought to be delivered. The bird then flies away to deliver the message.

The bird will follow the rough instructions of the caster trying to find where to deliver its message. If the caster told the bird to deliver the message to the caster's wife who was at home, the bird will fly to the casters home (if within range of the spell) and visually look for the caster's wife. If the caster's wife cannot be found (inside where the bird can't go, not at home, disguised, etc.), the bird circle the area trying to find the target. The bird's ability to locate someone is only as good as a normal bird's - that is it can recognize a person by their face, or what they are wearing, but may get confused if there are many similar subjects.

The bird delivers the message as a series of squawks, which will get the words through, but not intonation or other verbal cues. Alternatively, a message may be attached to the bird physically. This message must be prepared ahead of time and the caster must have a way of attaching it to the bird.

A bird that fails to find its target by the end of the spell, vanishes without having delivered it. 

As a magical creature, the bird can also be sent to magical beacons as per the Beacon spell. In this case, the bird will deliver to the beacon, even if it is not in the possession of the intended target of the spell."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">The caster eats a feather and then whispers the words to the spell, summoning a small bird into existence. The bird will flutter about in front of the caster for 1 minute while the caster delivers a short message to it, as well as a verbal and mental picture of the person to whom the message ought to be delivered. The bird then flies away to deliver the message.<br /><br />The bird will follow the rough instructions of the caster trying to find where to deliver its message. If the caster told the bird to deliver the message to the caster&#039;s wife who was at home, the bird will fly to the casters home (if within range of the spell) and visually look for the caster&#039;s wife. If the caster&#039;s wife cannot be found (inside where the bird can&#039;t go, not at home, disguised, etc.), the bird circle the area trying to find the target. The bird&#039;s ability to locate someone is only as good as a normal bird&#039;s - that is it can recognize a person by their face, or what they are wearing, but may get confused if there are many similar subjects.<br /><br />The bird delivers the message as a series of squawks, which will get the words through, but not intonation or other verbal cues. Alternatively, a message may be attached to the bird physically. This message must be prepared ahead of time and the caster must have a way of attaching it to the bird.<br /><br />A bird that fails to find its target by the end of the spell, vanishes without having delivered it. <br /><br />As a magical creature, the bird can also be sent to magical beacons as per the Beacon spell. In this case, the bird will deliver to the beacon, even if it is not in the possession of the intended target of the spell.</div>

Example: A minor sealing ward is placed over on a door frame, with creatures on either side. One creature opens the door, setting off the ward. Those on the ward side of the door save for half damage, taking full on a fail, while those on the opposite side save for no damage, taking half on a fail.

A creature or object under the effects of a Perception Filter is visible but unnoticed. As long as the subject does not speak to anyone or draw attention to themselves in any way, they are unnoticed. A guard on a door would notice an individual under the effects of this spell if they approached the door alone, but would not noticed one extra person in a large group that is not supposed to be there. 

A companion to someone under the effect of this spell might lose track of them in a large crowd or forget that they're around somewhere. Moving through crowds is simple, as most people see but do not notice others in a crowd.

A merchant might not notice someone under the effects of this spell take something small and off to the side from their table of wares, but would notice if that same someone came around to the merchants side of the stall, or stood directly in front of the merchant, or tried to pilfer their masterpiece on display.

The spell works best when the target of the spell makes an effort to be out of the way and unimportant. If there is a question as to whether or not someone is noticed, the noticer should make a saving throw.

Things that will break the spell include, but are not limited to: any attack, spell casting, speaking to a person, making noises, wearing out of place clothes, or using a mirror to reflect light into someone's eye."}</textarea>

"description":"When this spell is cast upon a piece of rope from 5 to 30 feet long, one end of the rope rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular, as if affixed at the upper end. The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an extradimensional space. 

The spellcaster and up to seven others can climb up the rope and disappear into this place of safety where no creature can find them. The rope can be taken into the extradimensional space if fewer than eight persons have climbed it; otherwise, it simply stays hanging in the air (extremely strong creatures might be able to remove it, at the DM's option). 

Spells cannot be cast across the interdimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if there were a 3-foot x 5-foot window centered on the rope. 

The persons in the extradimensional space must climb down prior to the end of the spell, or they are dropped from the height at which they entered the extradimensional space. 

The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time. 

Note that the rope trick spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space. 
Also note that creating or taking extradimensional spaces into an existing extradimensional space is hazardous.

The material components of this spell are powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of parchment."}</textarea>

For each size difference to the caster (larger or smaller), the target of the spell receives a cumulative +2 bonus to their save. If the shadow leaves the blade (lighting changes for example) the spell is broken.

Whether the subject of the spell is able to reach, grasp, and withdraw the blade is dependent upon the circumstances.

Two masks must be created, one that looks outward, and one that looks inward. The outward facing mask has the shape of a person, animal, or monster as seen by another person - a typical face. The masks that look in are shaped as if to be donned, but must also match the outward mask. When the wizard \"wears\" the inward mask and casts the spell they see as if their face was the outward mask. They cannot move the outward mask, but may move the eyes, which might be noticed by someone observing the outward mask.

The second version of the spell has a duration of 1 round / level, during which time the wizard may switch between various masks if they have more than one.

Should a mask be damaged, it may cease to function. This is checked the first time the mask is used after being damaged. A mask 10% damaged has a 10% chance of failing. If this check is passed, it will continue to function until further damaged. Damage to the gems that function as eyes destroyed the magic."}</textarea>

"description":"By casting this spell, the wizard learns what ingredients and formulas were used to create a chemical mixture or magical item.

The information instantly appears in the caster's mind but may be lost if the wizard cannot comprehend it. The caster must roll an Intelligence check; if successful, the wizard understands the formula and retains it in his memory. If the roll is missed, the caster cannot comprehend what he has learned and the information is immediately forgotten. If the spell is cast a second time on the same substance, the spell automatically fails unless the wizard has advanced to the next experience level.

The caster's level determines the type of information gleaned:

5th Level: The type and quantity of ingredients and the preparation process required to produce a non-magical mixture are learned. For example, the wizard could learn how to produce Greek fire or gunpowder, or could learn the recipe for something simple, like chocolate cake.

9th Level: The wizard may learn the proper ingredients and formula for making a magical liquid (potion, scroll ink, etc.).

14th Level: The caster may learn the formula for creating any type of magical object, excluding unique items and objects of extreme power (artifacts and relics).

In all cases, simply knowing the proper formula does not mean the wizard can successfully create the item or material. The construction of alchemical mixtures and magical items is a time consuming and expensive undertaking.

This spell has detrimental effects on the magical item analyzed. Single-use items (potions, oils, etc.) are automatically destroyed; the spell consumes the item in the process of analyzing it. Reusable magical items must make a saving throw vs. disintegration. If the saving throw is failed, Alamir's fundamental breakdown releases the magic of the item in an explosive blast, rendering it permanently nonmagical. The caster suffers 4d8 points of damage from the explosion.

The material component is a wand cut from a 100-year-old oak tree. The wand is used to touch the item in question, and vanishes in a puff of smoke when the spell is complete."}</textarea>

Single-use items (potions, oils, etc.) are automatically destroyed; the spell consumes the item in the process of analyzing it. Reusable magical items must make a saving throw vs. disintegration. If the saving throw is failed, Alamir&#039;s fundamental breakdown releases the magic of the item in an explosive blast, rendering it permanently nonmagical. The caster suffers 4d8 points of damage from the explosion.<br /><br />The material component is a wand cut from a 100-year-old oak tree. The wand is used to touch the item in question, and vanishes in a puff of smoke when the spell is complete.</div>

Therefore, if Zula the Diviner casts this spell on his tower's entrance, he could name only himself as one to enter, but allow anyone to exit. Alternatively, when Maelie the Sorcerer casts this spell on house, he could name himself, Jada the Cleric of Bahamut, and Heather the Ranger as those that may enter, and the same people plus Bobby the Squire as those who may exit.

Specific people to be granted access must be known and named. The caster must have an accurate mental image of the person, they may not be known by rough description or a painting. Having met or scryed (with something like Clairvoyance) upon the person is accurate enough. Further discriminations similar to those found in the Magic Mouth spell can be made.

\"Myself and Goblin women weigh over 200lb, carrying a curved sword, and singing their national anthem in ogre may enter, anybody may exit\" would be a successful casting. \"Myself and those I slap in the face may enter, those that live in Westport may exit\" would fail (both the slapping and the living in Westport violate the conditions of the spell).

With this spell it is possible for a wizard to create conditions which they cannot fulfill, preventing themselves from opening the door.

The components of the spell are a lock and key made out of pure silver, costing no less than 200gp, which are consumed in the casting of the spell.

"description":"By means of this spell, the wizard causes his material form to \"blink\" directly from one point to another at a random time and in a random direction. This means that melee attacks against the wizard automatically miss if initiative indicates they fall after he has blinked.

Each round the spell is in effect, the wizard rolls 2d8 to determine the timing of the blink - the result of the dice roll is used as the wizards initiative for that round. The wizard disappears and instantaneously reappears 10 feet distant from his previous position. (Direction is determined by roll of ld8: 1 = right ahead, 2 = right, 3 = right behind, 4 = behind, 5 = left behind, 6 = left, 7 left ahead, 8 = ahead.) 

The caster cannot blink into a solid object; if such is indicated, reroll the direction. Movable objects of size and mass comparable to the caster are shoved aside when the caster blinks in. If blinking is impossible except into a fixed, solid object, the caster is then trapped on the Ethereal plane.

During each round that he blinks, the spellcaster can be attacked only by opponents who win initiative or by those who are able to strike both locations at once (e.g., with a breath weapon, fireball, or similar wide-area attack forms). Opponents with multiple attacks, or those operating under haste or similar effects, can often strike early enough to have at least one attack against the caster.

If the spellcaster holds off his attack (if any) until after the blink, the 2d8 delay until the blink is added to his normal ldl0 initiative roll (thus he probably attacks last in the round). Or the spellcaster can try to get his attack in before he blinks (he must announce his intent before rolling the 2d8 for blink timing and the 1d10 for initiative). In this case, the caster compares the two dice rolls, hoping that his initiative roll is lower than his blink roll (the two rolls are not added if he is trying to attack before he blinks). If so, he attacks according to his initiative roll, then blinks according to the blink roll. 

If his blink roll is lower than his initiative roll, however, he blinks out, then he attacks in whatever direction he's facing (he must go through with his attack, even if he is facing in the wrong direction to affect anyone).

If the area is magically dark, only darkness is seen; if naturally pitch dark, only a 10-foot radius from the center of the spell's area of effect can be seen. Otherwise, the seeing extends to the normal vision range according to the prevailing light.

Anyone in the room with the caster can see from the caster's perspective by looking into the crystal ball. If the ball is too small, the caster's hands may cover it and prevent others from seeing.

Should someone use a true-seeing, detect magic, or other sort of divinations spells in the area, the spirit of the caster is revealed in their true likeness in the place they're standing. If the spirit form is struck with a magic weapon (Auto hit out of combat, AC10 in combat) or a dispel magic spell, the clairvoyance spell immediately ends. AOE spells have no effect on the spirit, but dragon fire and similar effects can."}</textarea>

"description":"When a wizard casts this spell, it has a chance to neutralize or negate magic it comes in contact with, as follows:

First, it removes spells and spell-like effects (including device effects and innate abilities) from creatures or objects.

Second, it disrupts the casting or use of these in the area of effect at the instant the dispel is cast. 

Third, it destroys magical potions (which are treated as 12th level for purposes of this spell). 

Each effect or potion in the spell's area is checked to determine if it is dispelled. The caster can always dispel his own magic; otherwise the chance to dispel depends on the difference in level between the magical effect and the caster. The base chance is 50% (11 or higher on 1d20 to dispel).

If the caster is higher level than the creator of the effect to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted from the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (thus making it more likely that the dispel succeeds); if the caster is of lower level, then the difference is added to the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (making it less likely that the dispel succeeds). A roll of 20 always succeeds and a roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher, only a roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dispelled.

A dispel magic spell does not affect a specially enchanted item, such as a magical scroll, ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous item, weapon, shield, or armor, unless it is cast directly upon the item. This renders the item nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An item possessed and carried by a creature gains the creature's saving throw against this effect, otherwise it is automatically rendered nonoperational. 

An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) rendered nonoperational would be temporarily closed. Note that an item's physical properties are unchanged: a nonoperational magical sword is still a sword.

Artifacts and relics are not subject to this spell; however, some of their spell-like effects may be, at the DMs option.
Note that this spell can be very effective when used upon charmed and similarly beguiled creatures. Certain spells or effects cannot be dispelled; these are listed in the spell descriptions."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell holds 1d4 humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile for five or more rounds.

The hold person spell affects any bipedal human, demihuman or humanoid of man-size or smaller, including brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others.

The spell is centered on a point selected by the caster; it affects persons selected by the caster within the area of effect.

If the spell is cast at three or four people, each gets an unmodified saving throw. If only two people are being enspelled, each makes his saving throw with a -1 penalty. If the spell is cast at only one person, the saving throw suffers a -3 penalty. Saving throws are adjusted for Wisdom. Those succeeding on their saving throws are unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.

Held beings cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison. The caster can end the spell with a single utterance at any time; otherwise the duration is 10 rounds at 5th level, 12 rounds at 6th level, 14 rounds at 7th level, etc.

The spellcaster needs a small, straight piece of iron as the material component of this spell.

"description":"This spell is coupled with the second level Beacon spell to get the location of a specific beacon. The caster will need a beacon to lock onto, a high quality and accurate map of the region the beacon is suspected to be in, and a crystal lens worth 50gp that is consumed in the casting.

If the beacon was created by the caster, no unusual preparations are needed; but if the beacon was created by another caster, then she must first cast Locate Beacon on the beacon itself. Preparation similar to that of Identify must be undertaken, clearing and cleaning a space, having silence and stillness, and ridding the room of any other magical items. After the cleansing is done, the Locate Beacon spell can be cast on the enchanted object to understand its resonance, and prepare the caster to seek it out later. Once prepared in this way, the caster need never prepare or attune to the beacon again. An Identify spell cast on the enchanted object will also work to link to the beacon.

When a beacon is to be located, a map must be produced and the crystal lens placed on it. The Locate Beacon spell is cast on both the map and the lens (just the one casting) and the caster may then look through the lens at the map to find its location. If the map is detailed and accurate enough, and the beacon is somewhere depicted on the map, it will be seen as a pulsing green light about 1\" in diameter. The beacon is within the area of the light, but not exactly at its center. Two casters locating the same beacon on two different maps, one twice the size of the other and covering the same region, will have two different tolerances. A caster using a desk sized map of the world may only be able to pin the beacon down to a single kingdom. A map of that kingdom might reveal the beacon is in or near a specific city. A map of that city might reveal the beacon is in a neighborhood or perhaps a specific building, depending on specific circumstances.

The map must be well made, well informed, accurate, and precise. Maps of this quality are often at least 100gp in value. 

Beacon and Locate Beacon are often used by powerful merchants and nobles to track larges shipments of money. A single coin may be made a beacon, tossed in with the rest, and if the shipment doesn't get to where it was heading, can be tracked down hopefully before too much is spent or distributed."}</textarea>

Example: a 40hp shell could block a 10 damage attack, a 5 damage attack, and then a 8 damage attack (leaving it at 17 hp). If the next attack were to do 9 points of damage, the shell would be broken and the subject would take 1 point of damage (half of 17 rounded down is 8, so the 1 extra damage goes through to the target).

The shell only blocks kinetic attacks (including falling), so breath weapons, fire, acid, etc. are not obstructed. Furthermore, the shell is activated when attacks come within the area of the shell, so it will trigger on missed attacks that roll at least a modified 10, or on attacks that must past through the shell's space, e.g. missile attacks at creatures behind one with magic shell. 

Whenever subjected to an attack, the whole shield becomes visible as a spherical grid. The visibility of the shield decreases as its HP decreases. When finally broken, the shield visually fractures and shatters."}</textarea>

Once a creature stops eating, they can no longer see the table, chairs, and food.

After 24 hours, the effects of the meal vanish and the creatures are left as if they had never consumed any of this food or dink. This spell may be chained together day after day, to nourish creatures for a longer period of time, but once the spell wears off, their bodies act as if they had never eaten any of the food.

"description":"When this spell is cast, the wizard creates a quasi-real, horse-like creature. The steed can be ridden only by the wizard who created it, or by any person for whom the wizard specifically creates such a mount.

A phantom steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound. Its eyes are milky-colored. It does not fight, but all normal animals shun it and only monstrous ones will attack. The mount has an Armor Class of 2 and 7 hit points, plus 1 per level of the caster. 

If it loses all of its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed moves at a movement rate of 4 per level of the spellcaster, to a maximum movement rate of 48. It has what seems to be a saddle and a bit and bridle. 

It can bear its rider's weight, plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.

These mounts gain certain powers according to the level of the wizard who created them:

8th Level: The ability to pass over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty.

10th Level: The ability to pass over water as if it were firm, dry ground.

12th Level: The ability to travel in the air as if it were firm land, so chasms and the like can be crossed without benefit of a bridge. Note, however, that the mount cannot casually take off and fly; the movement must be between points of similar altitude. 

14th Level: The ability to perform as if it were a pegasus; it flies at a rate of 48 per round upon command.

Note that a mount's abilities include those of lower levels; thus a 12th-level mount has the 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-level abilities.

Its attack is made as if it were a monster with Hit Dice equal to the level of the wizard who cast the spell. If it strikes successfully, the victim is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force, frozen and immobilized until released, either at the caster's command, by a successful dispel magic spell, or until a time equal to 1d4 days + 1 day per caster level has elapsed.

Until then, nothing can get at the victim, move the shimmering force surrounding him, or otherwise affect him. The victim does not age, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells while in this state. He is not aware of his surroundings.

If the sepia snake misses its target, it dissipates in a flash of brown light, with a loud noise and a puff of dun-colored smoke that is 10 feet in diameter and lasts for one round.

The spell cannot be detected by normal observation, and detect magic reveals only that the entire text is magical. A dispel magic can remove it; an erase spell destroys the entire page of text. It can be cast in combination with other spells that hide or garble text.

"description":"This spell conjures a corrosive, acidic slime of horrid strength on one surface or creature within the spell's range. Up to one square foot of surface area per caster level can be affected, so a 5th-level caster can affect 5 square feet - enough to create a 2-foot by 3-foot hole in a door or wall, or thoroughly drench a man-sized creature. The acid eats through 6 inches of wood, leather, or bone, 4 inches of stone, or 1 inch of metal each round. 

Against monsters composed of stone, metal or wood, the solvent inflicts 1d3 points of damage per caster level in the first round, 1d2 per caster level in the second round, and 1 per two caster levels in the third and final round. 

Therefore, a 10th-level wizard who strikes a Treant with solvent of corrosion inflicts 10d3, then 10d2 and finally 5 points of damage. Each round, the victim is allowed a saving throw vs. spell for half damage.

Against flesh, the solvent is much less effective; it is caustic and burns painfully, inflicting 1 point of damage per caster level in the first round, but no further damage in the second or third round. However, the burning in the following rounds does inflict a -2 penalty to the victim's attacks while the solvent is active. 

The solvent is extremely likely to cause extensive damage to the victim's armor and equipment; item saving throws vs. acid may apply at the DM's discretion. If the armor or equipment is magical in nature, then the saving throws is made with the usual bonuses allowed to the magical item.

The great alchemist Vandarien developed his solvent to dissolve iron grates, stone and woodwork traps, and other such hazards. The solvent's effectiveness against mineral or wood-based creatures was a mere side effect of his research. The material component of this spell is a mixture of vinegar, water, and a drop of black dragon acid."}</textarea>

"description":"When this spell is cast by the wizard, he influences the actions of the chosen recipient by the utterance of a few words - phrases or a sentence or two - suggesting a course of action desirable to the spellcaster. The creature to be influenced must, of course, be able to understand the wizards suggestion - it must be spoken in a language that the spell recipient understands.

The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the action sound reasonable; asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell. 

However, a suggestion that a pool of acid was actually pure water and that a quick dip would be refreshing is another matter. Urging a red dragon to stop attacking the wizards party so that the dragon and party could jointly loot a rich treasure elsewhere is likewise a reasonable use of the spell's power.

The course of action of a suggestion can continue in effect for a considerable duration, such as in the case of the red dragon mentioned above. 

Conditions that will trigger a special action can also be specified; if the condition is not met before the spell expires, then the action will not be performed. 

If the target successfully rolls its saving throw, the spell has no effect.
 
Note that a very reasonable suggestion causes the saving throw to be made with a penalty (such as -1, -2, etc.) at the discretion of the Dungeon Master. 

Undead are not subject to suggestion.

The material components of this spell are a snake's tongue and either a bit of honey-comb or a drop of sweet oil."}</textarea>

Urging a red dragon to stop attacking the wizards party so that the dragon and party could jointly loot a rich treasure elsewhere is likewise a reasonable use of the spell&#039;s power.<br /><br />The course of action of a suggestion can continue in effect for a considerable duration, such as in the case of the red dragon mentioned above. <br /><br />Conditions that will trigger a special action can also be specified; if the condition is not met before the spell expires, then the action will not be performed. <br /><br />If the target successfully rolls its saving throw, the spell has no effect.<br /> <br />Note that a very reasonable suggestion causes the saving throw to be made with a penalty (such as -1, -2, etc.) at the discretion of the Dungeon Master. <br /><br />Undead are not subject to suggestion.<br /><br />The material components of this spell are a snake&#039;s tongue and either a bit of honey-comb or a drop of sweet oil.</div>

"description":"The caster speaks the words to the spell while holding the essence of the creature in their primary hand.

This spell does not bring any weapons, armor, or equipment that the creature wasn't already wearing.

The caster must physically touch the creature when it pulls it through the flame, but the creature does not appear held in the caster's hand. Instead it appears wherever desired within 10' of the caster.

Creatures that cannot understand the caster will simply attack whoever the caster indicates and cannot be called off once sent to attack. Creatures that can understand the cater will obey verbal commands to the best of their ability, but will not be self destructive.

The creature, upon being summoned, may make a check to burst the casters dominance on them. Both sides roll a d10+wil+levelx2 (or hit dice if level is not available), and if the creature meets or beats the caster, the creature is free. Semi-magical creatures get a +5 bonus to their roll, magical creatures get a +10, highly magical creatures get a +15. Natural 1s and 20s have no effect on this roll.

If the creature successfully bursts the spell, it becomes free willed and usually very angry at the summoner, who it will probably try to destroy.

Creatures that are bound may be dismissed with a gesture and a sound."}</textarea>

"description":"This divination spell allows a number of creatures to understand and be understood by other recipients of this spell. Each creature that is to understand must have their ears touched by the caster, while each of the creatures that is to be understood must have their mouth (or origin of their speech) touched. All subjects of the spell need to be smeared with ink on their forehead (or equivalent) by the caster, and the caster must continue intoning the words to the spell as they move between recipients. During the casting of the spell, none of the recipients that have been marked may leave the AOE, else their ink fades and they are removed from the spell's effects. It is possible to have 2 people who can speak and 10 people who can listen.

When the spell ends, which happens when the duration expires, the caster cancels it, or the caster's light concentration is broken, the ink fades from each of the subjects of the spell.

Example: A diviner wishes to hold an audience with a goblin queen and his party. The goblin queen does not speak common, so the diviner touches the ears of the party members, himself, and the queen, while touching the lips of the queen and himself. All are marked with ink. When the spell takes effect, the goblin will only understand the caster, while the party will understand the goblin. This way the party (caster not included) can speak in common without the goblin understanding, but all can understand the goblin."}</textarea>

Normal insects cannot pass such a barrier. Loose materials, even cloth garments, fly upward when caught in a wind wall. Arrows and bolts are deflected upward and miss, while sling stones and other missiles under two pounds in weight receive a -4 penalty to a first shot and - 2 penalties thereafter. 

Gases, most breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass this wall, although it is no barrier to noncorporeal creatures.

				<div class="description-content">This spell brings forth an invisible vertical curtain of wind two feet thick and of considerable strength - a strong breeze sufficient to blow away any bird smaller than an eagle or to tear papers and like materials from unsuspecting hands. (If in doubt, a saving throw vs. spell determines whether the subject maintains its grasp.) <br /><br />Normal insects cannot pass such a barrier. Loose materials, even cloth garments, fly upward when caught in a wind wall. Arrows and bolts are deflected upward and miss, while sling stones and other missiles under two pounds in weight receive a -4 penalty to a first shot and - 2 penalties thereafter. <br /><br />Gases, most breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass this wall, although it is no barrier to noncorporeal creatures.<br />The material components are a tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin.</div>

All possible subjects receive saving throws vs. spell, adjusted for Wisdom. Any damage inflicted by the caster or his allies in the round of casting grants the wounded creature another saving throw at a bonus of +1 per point of damage received. 
Any affected creature regards the spellcaster as friendly, an ally or companion to be treated well or guarded from harm. 
If communication is possible, the charmed creature follows reasonable requests, instructions, or orders most faithfully (see the suggestion spell). 

If communication is not possible, the creature does not harm the caster, but others in the vicinity may be subject to its intentions, hostile or otherwise. Any overtly hostile act by the caster breaks the spell, or at the very least allows a new saving throw against the charm. 

Affected creatures eventually come out from under the influence of the spell. This is a function of the creature's level (i.e., its Hit Dice).

"description":"This spell causes confusion in one or more creatures within the area, creating indecision and the inability to take effective action. The spell affects 1d4 creatures, plus one creature per caster level. 
These creatures are allowed saving throws vs. spell with -2 penalties, adjusted for Wisdom. Those successfully saving are unaffected by the spell. Confused creatures react as follows (roll 1d10):

1 Wander away (unless prevented) for duration of spell
2-6 Stand confused one round (then roll again)
7-9 Attack nearest creature for one round (then roll again)
10 Act normally for one round (then roll again)

The spell lasts for two rounds plus one round for each level of the caster. Those who fail are checked by the DM for actions each round for the duration of the spell, or until the \"wander away for the duration of the spell\" result occurs.

Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible, according to their most typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). Saving throws and actions are checked at the beginning of each round. Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature.

If there are many creatures involved, the DM may decide to assume average results. For example, if there are 16 orcs affected and 25% could be expected to make the saving throw, then four are assumed to have succeeded. Out of the other 12, one wanders away, four attack the nearest creature, six stand confused, and the last acts normally but must check next round. Since the orcs are not near the party, the DM decides that two attacking the nearest creature attack each other, one attacks an orc that saved, and one attacks a confused orc, which strikes back. The next round, the base is 11 orcs, since four originally saved and one wandered off. Another one wanders off, five stand confused, four attack, and one acts normally.

For example, a caster could not summon &quot;A black carriage&quot; or &quot;The queen&#039;s carriage&quot;. Moreover, the object must be solid and self contained. The caster cannot fill 400 cubic feet of poison gas or water or broken glass, etc. <br /><br />The item appears on the ground in the footprint outlined. The casting time is for the utterance of the spell, and does not include the time needed to make the outline, which is variable. </div>

2. Fear: The affected creatures flee in panic for 2d4 rounds. It counters (and is countered by) courage.

3. Friendship: The affected creatures react more positively (for example, tolerance becomes goodwill). It counters (and is countered by) hate.

4. Happiness: This effect creates joy and a feeling of complacent well-being, adding +4 to all reaction rolls and making attack unlikely unless the creatures are subject to extreme provocation. It counters (and is countered by) sadness.

5. Hate: The affected creatures react more negatively (for example, tolerance becomes negative neutrality). It counters (and is countered by) friendship.

6. Hope: The effect of hope is to raise morale, saving throw rolls, attack rolls, and damage caused by +2. It counters (and is countered by) hopelessness.

7. Hopelessness: The affected creatures submit to the demands of any opponent: surrender, get out, etc. Otherwise, the creatures are 25% likely to do nothing in a round, and 25% likely to turn back or retreat. It counters (and is countered by) hope.

8. Sadness: This creates unhappiness and a tendency toward maudlin introspection. This emotion penalizes surprise rolls by -1 and adds +1 to initiative rolls. It counters (and is countered by) happiness.

All creatures in the area at the instant the spell is cast are affected unless successful saving throws vs. spell are made, adjusted for Wisdom. The spell lasts as long as the wizard continues to concentrate on projecting the chosen emotion.

Any creatures observing the fire or the dancing circle of flame around it must successfully roll a saving throw vs. spell or be charmed into remaining motionless and gazing, transfixed, at the flames. While so charmed, creatures are subject to suggestions of 12 or fewer words, saving vs. spell with a -3 penalty, adjusted for Wisdom.

The fire charm is broken if the charmed creature is physically attacked, if a solid object comes between the creature and the veil of flames so as to obstruct vision, or when the duration of the spell expires.

The hallucinatory terrain persists until a dispel magic spell is cast upon the area or until the duration expires. Individual creatures may see through the illusion, but the illusion persists, affecting others who observe the scene.

When the spell is used to hide pits, traps, or normal doors, normal demihuman and magical detection abilities work normally, and touch or probing searches reveal the true nature of the surface, though they do not cause the illusion to disappear.<br /><br />The material component is a rare dust that costs at least 400 gp and requires four days to prepare.</div>

"description":"By casting this spell, the wizard can empower a creature with superhuman strength. Unlike the 2nd-level strength spell, improved strength allows the recipient of the spell to ignore race or class restrictions on his maximum Strength score, possibly reaching scores as high as 25. The exact amount of strength gained varies by the recipient’s class group:

Class    Strength   Gain*
Warrior  1d8+4      (max 25)
Priest   1d6+4      (max 23)
Rogue    1d6+4      (max 23)
Wizard   1d4+4      (max 21)

* Count each percentile bracket of exceptional strength as one point; the strength gain proceeds as 18, 18/01, 18/51, 18/76, 18/91, 18/00, 19, and so on.

Even if the recipient is not a warrior, he gains all the benefits of an exceptional Strength category; for example, if a thief with a Strength of 14 gained 7 points, he would possess a Strength of 18/76 for the duration of the spell. In addition to the attack and damage bonus, increased chance to open doors or bend bars, and increased carrying capacity, the spell recipient may temporarily gain the ability to throw boulders as a giant of equivalent Strength, as shown below:

Strength Giant Type   Range     Damage
19       Hill giant   80 yards  1d6
20       Stone giant  100 yards 1d8
21       Frost giant  100 yards 1d8
22       Fire giant   120 yards 1d8
23       Cloud giant  140 yards 1d10
24       Storm giant  160 yards 1d12
25       Titan        200 yards 1d20

When the spell ends, the recipient is struck by intense exhaustion; he can do nothing except rest for 1d3 full turns to recover his strength. The material component is a strand of hair from a giant."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell enables the wizard to magically call into being a sturdy cottage or lodge, made of material that is common in the area where the spell is cast - stone, timber, or (at worst) sod. The floor area of the lodging is 30 square feet per level of the spellcaster, and the surface is level, clean, and dry. In all respects the lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door, two or more shuttered windows, and a small fireplace.

While the lodging is secure against winds of up to 70 miles per hour, it has no heating or cooling source (other than natural insulation qualities). Therefore it must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security otherwise, as it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition, resists flames and fire as if it were stone, and is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege machinery or giants).

The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being wizard locked and the latter being secured by a top grate of iron and a narrow flue. In addition, these three areas are protected by an alarm spell. Lastly, an unseen servant is called up to provide service to the spellcaster.

The inside of the shelter contains rude furnishings as desired by the spellcaster - up to eight bunks, a trestle table and benches, as many as four chairs or eight stools, and a writing desk.

The material components of this spell are a square chip of stone, crushed lime, a few grains of sand, a sprinkling of water, and several splinters of wood. These must be augmented by the components of the alarm and unseen servant spells if these benefits are to be included (string and silver wire and a small bell)."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell is similar to the 7th-level spell turning, which causes spells cast against the wizard to rebound on the original caster. This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the protected wizard, spell effects delivered by touch, and spell effects from devices such as wands, staves, and so forth. Thus, a light spell cast to blind the protected wizard could be turned back upon and possibly blind the caster, while the same spell would be unaffected if cast to light an area in which the protected wizard were standing.

One to four (1d4) spell levels may be turned. The exact number is secretly rolled by the DM; the player never knows how effective the spell is.

Unlike the 7th level version of this spell, minor spell turning is not capable of partially turning a spell. For example, if a wizard has three levels of spell turning, he can turn three 1st-level spells, one 1st and one 2nd, or one 3rd-level spell. He can in no way turn spells of 4th level or above. If the caster is the target of a spell of a higher level than he is capable of turning, the caster receives the full brunt of the spell.

If the protected wizard and a spellcasting attacker both have spell turning effects operating, a resonating field is created that has the following effects. (See book for table).

"description":"When this spell is cast, the wizard creates the illusion of the most fearsome thing imaginable to the victim, simply by forming the fears of the victim's subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize - the most horrible beast.

Only the spell recipient can see the phantasmal killer (the caster sees only a shadowy shape), but if it succeeds in scoring a hit, the subject dies from fright. 

The beast attacks as a 4 Hit Dice monster. It is invulnerable to all attacks, and it can pass through any barriers. Once cast, it inexorably pursues the subject, for it exists only in the subject's mind.

The only defenses against a phantasmal killer are an attempt to disbelieve (which can be tried but once), slaying or rendering unconscious the wizard who cast the spell, or rendering unconscious the target of the spell for its duration. 

To disbelieve the killer, the subject must specifically state the attempt and then roll an Intelligence check. This roll has a -1 penalty for every four levels of the caster. Special modifiers apply to this attack:

If surprised, the roll is modified -2;
If the subject has previously been attack by this spell, the roll is modified +1;
If the subject is an illusionist, the roll is modified +2;
If the subject is wearing a helm of telepathy, the roll is modified +3;

Magic resistance, bonuses against fear, and Wisdom adjustments also apply. 

Magic resistance is checked first to determine Spell operation, and then the fear/Wisdom bonus applies as a minus to the dice roll to match or score less than Intelligence.

If the subject of a phantasmal killer attack succeeds in disbelieving, and he is wearing a helm of telepathy, the beast can be turned upon the wizard, who must then disbelieve it or be subject to its attack and possible effects.

If the subject ignores the killer to perform other actions, such as attacking the caster, the killer may, at the DMs option, gain bonuses to hit (for flank or rear attacks, etc.). Spells such as remove fear and cloak of bravery, cast after the killer has attacked, grant another check to disbelieve the effect."}</textarea>

"description":"The polymorph other spell is a powerful magic that completely alters the form and ability, and possibly the personality and mentality, of the recipient. Of course, while a creature with a lower Intelligence can be polymorphed in form into something with a higher Intelligence, it will not gain that creature's mental ability. 

The reverse - polymorphing a higher Intelligence creature into one of significantly lower Intelligence - results in a creature much more intelligent than appearances would lead one to believe. The polymorphed creature must succeed on a system shock (see Table 3) roll to see if it survives the change. After this, it must make a special Intelligence check to see if it retains its personality (see following).

The polymorphed creature acquires the and physical abilities of the creature it has been polymorphed into, while retaining its own mind. Form includes natural Armor Class (that due to skin toughness, but not due to quickness, magical nature, etc.), physical movement abilities (walking, swimming, flight with wings, but not plane shifting, blinking, teleporting, etc.), and attack routines (claw/claw/bite, swoop, rake, constriction, but not petrification, breath weapons, energy drain, etc.).

Hit points and saving throws do not change from the original form. Noncorporeal forms cannot be assumed. Natural shapeshifters (lycanthropes, doppelgangers, higher level druids, etc.) are affected for but one round, and can then resume their normal form.
If slain, the polymorphed creature reverts to its original form (it's still dead, though). (Note that most creatures generally prefer their own form and will not willingly stand the risk of being subjected to this spell!) As class and level are not attributes of form, abilities derived from either cannot be gained by this spell, nor can exact ability scores be specified.

When the polymorph occurs, the creature's equipment, if any, melds into the new form (in particularly challenging campaigns, the DM may allow protective devices, such as a ring of protection, to continue operating effectively). The creature retains its mental abilities, including spell use, assuming the new form allows completion of the proper verbal and somatic components and the material components are available. Creatures not used to a new form might be penalized at the DM's option (e.g., -2 to attack rolls) until they practice sufficiently to master it.

When the physical change occurs, there is a base 100% chance that the subjects personality and mentality change into that of new form (i.e., a roll of 20 or less on 1d20). For each 1 point of Intelligence of the subject, subtract 1 from the base chance on 1d20. Additionally, for every Hit Die of difference between the original form and the form it is assuming, add or subtract 1 (depending on whether polymorphed form has more Hit Dice [or levels) or fewer Hit Dice [or levels] than original, respectively). The chance for assumption of the personality and mentality of the new form is checked daily until the change takes place.

A subject acquiring the mentality of the new form has effectively become the creature whose form was assumed and comes under the control of the DM until recovered by a wish spell or similar magic. Once this final change takes place, the creature acquires the new form's full range of magical and special abilities.

Example: If a 1 Hit Die orc of 8 Intelligence is polymorphed into a white dragon with 6 Hit Dice, for example, it is 85% (20- 8 Intelligence + 5 levels difference [16-1]=17 out of 20= 85%) likely to actually become one in all respects, but in any case it has the dragon's physical and mental capabilities. If it does not assume the personality and mentality of a white dragon, it knows what it formerly knew as well.

The wizard can use a dispel magic spell to change the polymorphed creature back to its original form, and this requires a system shock roll. Those who have lost their individuality and are then converted back maintain the belief that they are actually the polymorphed creature and attempt to return to that form. Thus, the orc who comes to believe he is a white dragon, when converted back to his orc form, steadfastly maintains he is really a white dragon polymorphed into the shape of an orc. His companions will most likely consider him mad.

The material component of this spell is a caterpillar cocoon."}</textarea>

"description":"By means of this spell, the wizard creates a glowing, rainbow-hued band of interweaving patterns. Any creature caught in it may become fascinated and gaze at it as long as the effect lasts.

The spell can captivate a maximum of 24 levels, or Hit Dice, of creatures - 24 creatures with 1 Hit Die each, 12 with 2 Hit Dice, etc. All creatures affected must be within the area of effect, and each is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. An attack on an affected creature that causes damage frees it from the spell immediately. Creatures that are restrained and removed from the area still try to follow the pattern.

Once the rainbow pattern is cast, the wizard need only gesture in the direction he desires, and the pattern of colors moves slowly off in that direction, at the rate of 30 feet per round. It persists without further attention from the spellcaster for 1d3 rounds. All affected creatures follow the moving rainbow of light. If the pattern leads its subjects into a dangerous area (through flame, off a cliff, etc.), allow a second saving throw. If the view of the lights is completely blocked (by an obscurement spell, for instance), the spell is negated.

The wizard need not utter a sound, but he must gesture appropriately while holding a crystal prism and the material component, a piece of phosphor."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">By means of this spell, the wizard creates a glowing, rainbow-hued band of interweaving patterns. Any creature caught in it may become fascinated and gaze at it as long as the effect lasts.<br /><br />The spell can captivate a maximum of 24 levels, or Hit Dice, of creatures - 24 creatures with 1 Hit Die each, 12 with 2 Hit Dice, etc. All creatures affected must be within the area of effect, and each is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. An attack on an affected creature that causes damage frees it from the spell immediately. Creatures that are restrained and removed from the area still try to follow the pattern.<br /><br />Once the rainbow pattern is cast, the wizard need only gesture in the direction he desires, and the pattern of colors moves slowly off in that direction, at the rate of 30 feet per round. It persists without further attention from the spellcaster for 1d3 rounds. All affected creatures follow the moving rainbow of light. If the pattern leads its subjects into a dangerous area (through flame, off a cliff, etc.), allow a second saving throw. If the view of the lights is completely blocked (by an obscurement spell, for instance), the spell is negated.<br /><br />The wizard need not utter a sound, but he must gesture appropriately while holding a crystal prism and the material component, a piece of phosphor.</div>

"description":"Upon casting this spell, the wizard is usually able to remove a curse - whether it is on an object, or a person, or in the form of some undesired sending or evil presence.

Note that the remove curse spell cannot affect a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, for example, although it usually enables a person afflicted with a cursed item to be rid of it.

Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell, or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or more. A caster of 12th level or more can cure lycanthropy with this spell by casting it on the animal form. The were-creature receives a saving throw vs. spell and, if successful, the spell fails and the wizard must gain a level before attempting the remedy again.

The reverse of the spell is not permanent; the bestow curse lasts for one turn for every experience level of the wizard casting the spell. It causes one of the following effects (roll percentile dice):

Between 1 and 50 bestow curse lowers one ability of the subject to 3 (the DM determines which by random selection)
Between 51 and 75 bestow curse worsens the subject's attack rolls and saving throws by -4
Between 76 and 00 bestow curse makes the subject 50% likely per turn to drop whatever it is holding (or simply do nothing, in the case of creatures not using tools)

It is possible for a wizard to devise his own curse, and it should be similar in power to those given (the DM has final say). 

The subject of a bestow curse spell must be touched. If the subject is touched, a saving throw is still applicable; if it is successful, the effect is negated. The bestowed curse cannot be dispelled."}</textarea>

"description":"A wizard casting the shadow monsters spell uses material from the plane of Shadow to shape semi-real illusions of one or more monsters. The total Hit Dice of the shadow monster or monsters thus created cannot exceed the level of experience of the wizard; thus a 10th-level wizard can create one creature that has 10 Hit Dice, two that have 5 Hit Dice, etc. All shadow monsters created by one spell must be of the same sort.

The actual hit point total for each monster is 20% of the hit point total it would normally have. (To determine this, roll the appropriate Hit Dice and multiply the hit points by 0.2. Any remainder less than 0.4 is dropped - in the case of monsters with 1 or fewer Hit Dice, this indicates the monster was not successfully created - and scores between .4 and 1 are rounded up to 1 hit point.)
Those viewing the shadow monsters are allowed to disbelieve as per normal illusions, although there is a -2 penalty to the attempt. The shadow monsters perform as the real monsters with respect to Armor Class and attack forms. Those who believe in the shadow monsters suffer real damage from their attacks. Special attack forms such as petrification or level drain do not actually occur, but a subject who believes they are real will react appropriately.

Those who roll successful saving throws see the shadow monsters as transparent images superimposed on vague shadowy forms. These are Armor Class 10 and inflict only 20% of normal melee damage (biting, clawing, weapon, etc.), dropping fractional damage less than 0.4 as done with hit points.

Example: A shadow monster griffon attacks a person who knows it is only quasi-real. The monster strikes with two claw attacks and one bite, hitting as a 7-Hit Die monster. All three attacks hit, and the normal damage dice are rolled, multiplied by 0.2 separately, rounded up or down, then added together to get total damage. Thus if the attacks score 4, 2, and 11 points, then a total of 4 points of damage is inflicted (4 x 0.2 = 0.8 [rounded to 1], 2 x 0.2 = 0.4 [rounded to 1], 11 x 0.2 = 2.2 [rounded to 2]. The sum is 1 + 1 + 2 = 4)."}</textarea>

Even a sword of sharpness cannot affect a creature protected by stoneskin, nor can a rock hurled by a giant, a snake's strike, etc. However, magical attacks from such spells as fireball, magic missile, lightning bolt, and so forth have their normal effects.

The spell blocks 1d4 attacks, plus one attack per two levels of experience the caster has achieved. This limit applies regardless of attack rolls and regardless of whether the attack was physical or magical. 

For example, a stoneskin spell cast by a 9th-level wizard would protect against from five to eight attacks. An attacking griffon would reduce the protection by three each round; four magic missiles would count as four attacks in addition to inflicting their normal damage.

The material components of the spell are granite and 50gp worth diamond dust sprinkled on the recipient's skin."}</textarea>

The maximum range of attack is equal to 50 feet plus 10 feet per level of the caster. Only the caster may throw the pebble.

The wizard can enchant one stone at 7th level and gains one stone per three levels of experience thereafter (two stones at 10th level, three at 13th level, etc.). Only one pebble may be thrown per round, and pebbles must be hurled in consecutive rounds. The spell has a duration in rounds equal to the number of pebbles enchanted. Each pebble requires a separate attack roll. Pebbles may be thrown at different targets within range.

The material components are pebbles, which revert to normal size when the spell expires.

The reverse of this spell ,turn boulder to pebble, shrinks a boulder to the size of a pebble. It affects only naturally occurring rocks and can not be used to shrink a statue or a cut gemstone.

The number of rocks that may be affected is equal to the number of experience levels of the caster. Boulders must not exceed one cubic foot per level of the caster. Thus, a 10th-level wizard could shrink 10 rocks, each of which is equal to or less than 10 cubic feet in size. All rocks are affected in the same round the spell is cast. Though they need not be touched, the boulders must be within 50 feet of the caster. Boulders that have been shrunk remain so until dispelled."}</textarea>

"description":"When this spell is employed, the wizard creates an invisible sensory organ that sends him visual information. The wizard eye travels at 30 feet per round if viewing an area ahead as a human would (i.e., primarily looking at the floor), or 10 feet per round if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. 

The wizard eye can see with infravision up to 10 feet, and with normal vision up to 60 feet away in brightly lit areas. The wizard eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. 

It has substance and a form that can be detected (by a detect invisibility spell, for instance). Solid barriers prevent the passage of a wizard eye, although it can pass through a space no smaller than a small mouse hole (one inch in diameter).

Using the eye requires the wizard to concentrate. However, if his concentration is broken, the spell does not end - the eye merely becomes inert until the wizard again concentrates, subject to the duration of the spell. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The caster is subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. 

A successful dispel cast on the wizard or eye ends the spell. With respect to blindness, magical darkness, and so on, the wizard eye is considered an independent sensory organ of the caster.

The material component of the spell is a bit of bat fur."}</textarea>

"description":"There are actually four spells in the conjure elemental spell. 

The wizard is able to conjure an air, earth, fire, or water elemental with this spell - assuming he has the material component for the particular elemental. (A considerable fire source must be in range to conjure a fire elemental; a large amount of water must be available to conjure a water elemental.) Conjured elementals have 8 Hit Dice.

It is possible to conjure successive elementals of different types if the spellcaster has memorized two or more of these spells. The type of elemental to be conjured must be decided upon before memorizing the spell. Each type of elemental can be conjured only once per day.

The conjured elemental must be controlled by the wizard - the spellcaster must concentrate on the elemental doing his commands - or it turns on the wizard and attacks. The elemental will not break off a combat to do so, but it will avoid creatures while seeking its conjurer. If the wizard is wounded or grappled, his concentration is broken. 

There is always a 5% chance that the elemental turns on its conjurer regardless of concentration. This check is made at the end of the second and each succeeding round.

An elemental that breaks free of its control can be dispelled by the caster, but the chance of success is only 50%. The elemental can be controlled up to 30 yards away per level of the spellcaster. The elemental remains until its form on this plane is destroyed due to damage or until the spell's duration expires. 

Note that water elementals are destroyed if they are ever more than 60 yards from a large body of water.

The material component of the spell (besides the quantity of the element at hand) is a small amount of one of the following:
    Air Elemental - burning incense
    Earth Elemental - soft clay
    Fire Elemental - sulphur and phosphorus
    Water Elemental - water and sand

Special protection from uncontrolled elementals is available by means of a protection from evil spell."}</textarea>

If the wizard is wounded or grappled, his concentration is broken. <br /><br />There is always a 5% chance that the elemental turns on its conjurer regardless of concentration. This check is made at the end of the second and each succeeding round.<br /><br />An elemental that breaks free of its control can be dispelled by the caster, but the chance of success is only 50%. The elemental can be controlled up to 30 yards away per level of the spellcaster. The elemental remains until its form on this plane is destroyed due to damage or until the spell&#039;s duration expires. <br /><br />Note that water elementals are destroyed if they are ever more than 60 yards from a large body of water.<br /><br />The material component of the spell (besides the quantity of the element at hand) is a small amount of one of the following:<br />    Air Elemental - burning incense<br />    Earth Elemental - soft clay<br />    Fire Elemental - sulphur and phosphorus<br />    Water Elemental - water and sand<br /><br />Special protection from uncontrolled elementals is available by means of a protection from evil spell.</div>

"description":"When this spell is cast, the wizard sends his mind to another plane of existence in order to receive advice and information from powers there. As these powers resent such contact, only brief answers are given. (The DM answers all questions with \"yes,\" \"no,\" \"maybe,\" \"never,\" \"irrelevant,\" etc.) Any questions asked are answered by the power during the spell's duration. The character can contact an elemental plane or some plane farther removed. For every two levels of experience of the wizard, one question may be asked. Contact with minds far removed from the plane of the wizard increases the probability of the spellcaster going insane or dying, but the chance of the power knowing the answer, as well as the probability of the being telling the correct answer, are likewise increased by moving to distant planes. Once the Outer Planes are reached, the Intelligence of the power contacted determines the effects.

The accompanying random table is subject to DM changes, development of extraplanar NPC beings, and so on.

If insanity occurs, it strikes as soon as the first question is asked. This condition lasts for one week for each removal of the plane contacted (see the DMG or the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set), to a maximum of 10 weeks. There is a 1% chance per plane that the wizard dies before recovering, unless a remove curse spell is cast upon him. A surviving wizard can recall the answer to the question.

On rare occasions, this divination may be blocked by the action of certain lesser or greater powers.

Plane               Insanity *  Knowledge  Veracity **
Elemental Plane     20%         55% (90%)  62% (75%)
Inner Plane         25%         60%        65%
Astral Plane        30%         65%        67%
Outer Plane, Int 19 35%         70%        70%
Outer Plane, Int 20 40%         75%        73%
Outer Plane, Int 21 45%         80%        75%
Outer Plane, Int 22 50%         85%        78%
Outer Plane, Int 23 55%         90%        81%
Outer Plane, Int 24 60%         95%        85%
Outer Plane, Int 25 65%         98%        90%

* For every point of Intelligence over 15, the wizard reduces the chance of insanity by 5%.
** If the being does not know an answer, and the chance of veracity is not made, the being will emphatically give an incorrect answer. If the chance of veracity is made, the being will answer “unknown.”

Percentages in parentheses are for questions that pertain to the appropriate elemental plane.

Optional Rule
The DM may allow a specific Outer Plane to be contacted (see the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set). In this case, the difference in alignment between the caster and the plane contacted alters the maximum Intelligence that can be contacted--each difference in moral or ethical alignment lowers the maximum Intelligence that can be contacted by 1. For example, an 18th-level lawful good caster could contact Mount Celestia (a lawful good plane) on the \"Intelligence 20\" line, or Elysium (a neutral good plane) on the \"Intelligence 19\" line."}</textarea>

"description":"The dream spell enables the caster, or a messenger touched by the caster, to send messages to others in the form of dreams. At the beginning of the spell, the caster must name the recipient or identify him by some title that leaves no doubt as to his identity.

As the caster completes the spell, the person sending the spell falls into a deep trancelike sleep, and instantaneously projects his mind to the recipient. The sender then enters the recipient's dream and delivers the message unless the recipient is magically protected. If the recipient is awake, the message sender can choose to remain in the trancelike sleep. If the sender is disturbed during this time, the spell is immediately cancelled and the sender comes out of the trance. The whereabouts and current activities of the recipient cannot be learned through this spell.

The sender is unaware of his own surroundings or the activities around him while he is in his trance. He is totally defenseless, both physically and mentally (i.e., he always fails any saving throw) while in the trance. Once the recipient's dreams are entered, the sender can deliver a message of any length, which the recipient remembers perfectly upon waking. The communication is one-way; the recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the sender gain any information by observing the dreams of the recipient. Once the message is delivered, the sender's mind returns instantly to his body. The duration of the spell is the time required for the sender to enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message.

The reverse of this spell, nightmare, enables the caster to send a hideous and unsettling vision to the recipient, who is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. The nightmare prevents restful sleep and causes 1d10 points of damage. The nightmare leaves the recipient fatigued and unable to regain spells for the next day. A dispel evil spell cast upon the recipient stuns the caster of the nightmare for one turn per level of the cleric countering this evil sending."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">The dream spell enables the caster, or a messenger touched by the caster, to send messages to others in the form of dreams. At the beginning of the spell, the caster must name the recipient or identify him by some title that leaves no doubt as to his identity.<br /><br />As the caster completes the spell, the person sending the spell falls into a deep trancelike sleep, and instantaneously projects his mind to the recipient. The sender then enters the recipient&#039;s dream and delivers the message unless the recipient is magically protected. If the recipient is awake, the message sender can choose to remain in the trancelike sleep. If the sender is disturbed during this time, the spell is immediately cancelled and the sender comes out of the trance. The whereabouts and current activities of the recipient cannot be learned through this spell.<br /><br />The sender is unaware of his own surroundings or the activities around him while he is in his trance. He is totally defenseless, both physically and mentally (i.e., he always fails any saving throw) while in the trance. Once the recipient&#039;s dreams are entered, the sender can deliver a message of any length, which the recipient remembers perfectly upon waking. The communication is one-way; the recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the sender gain any information by observing the dreams of the recipient. Once the message is delivered, the sender&#039;s mind returns instantly to his body. The duration of the spell is the time required for the sender to enter the recipient&#039;s dream and deliver the message.<br /><br />The reverse of this spell, nightmare, enables the caster to send a hideous and unsettling vision to the recipient, who is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. The nightmare prevents restful sleep and causes 1d10 points of damage. The nightmare leaves the recipient fatigued and unable to regain spells for the next day. A dispel evil spell cast upon the recipient stuns the caster of the nightmare for one turn per level of the cleric countering this evil sending.</div>

"description":"Naturally, this spell is an improvement of the 3rd-level alteration spell blink, allowing the wizard to shift his body to any point within 15 feet of his current location. Unlike the lower-level spell, improved blink allows the wizard to choose the exact time of his jump, the exact destination, and the orientation or facing of his choosing. For example, a wizard confronted by an enemy fighter could blink just before the fighter attacked, reappearing directly behind his foe for a back attack. If the wizard blinks away from an attack, his enemy automatically misses - but creatures with multiple attacks may be able to reposition themselves for another swing if the wizard blinks to a location within reach.

If the wizard intends to take any action such as attacking, casting a spell, or using a magical item, he must decide before the round begins if he will do so before or after he blinks. If he acts before he blinks, he may be endangered by an attack before he finishes; he can choose to proceed with his action, hoping that he won’t be hit, or he can abort his action by taking his blink for the round. On the other hand, if the wizard begins his action after his blink, the initiative modifier of his attack or spell is added to the time of his blink to determine when he attacks.

A blinking wizard dueling a fighter decides to blink first, when the fighter attacks and then lightning bolt the offensive fellow. The fighter rolls a modified 6 for initiative, so the wizard waits until 6, then blinks, making the fighter miss. At that time, he starts his lightning bolt, which has a casting time of 3-the spell will go off on 9.

In the Player’s Option: Combat & Tactics initiative system, the wizard must count 1, 2, or 3 phases from the time of his blink for fast, average, or slow actions. If the fighter above attacked in the average phase, the wizard would blink during the fighter’s attack, and then his lightning bolt (a fast spell) would go off 1 phase later, with any other slow actions.

Because the wizard can pick the location he is blinking to, he may not choose to blink into a movable object in order to force it aside - he must blink to an area clear of obstructions or obstacles. If he does attempt to blink into a movable object, he will find himself displaced to a random location (use the blink 1d8 rules in the PHB for determining where he ends up)."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell allows the caster to more easily access rare or dangerous spell components. The wizard casts this spell upon a silver mirror while concentrating on a mental image of the material he desires. The base chance of success is 50%, modified by the following factors:

+1% per level of the caster
+10% if the caster has seen the same type of substance or object before; this bonus is not cumulative with the following bonus
+20% if the caster has a sample of the material or the same type of object in his possession; this bonus is not cumulative with the bonus above
+30% if the wizard knows the location of the desired object
-50% if the caster has never seen the same type of material or item before

If the percentile roll indicates failure, the caster is unable to locate the desired ingredient and the spell ends. If the roll indicates success, the wizard has located the object or substance and the mirror becomes a magical gate through which the caster can see the target. The size of the gate is determined by the size of the mirror, to a maximum size of 3 feet by 2 feet.

The gate always appears within arm's length of the target, allowing the wizard to reach through the mirror, grasp the object of his desire, and draw it back through the gate. The wizard must risk his own safety--the gate does not allow the use of probes, long-handled ladles, tongs, or other equipment to gather the material. The caster cannot move completely through the gate.

The gate vanishes when the spell's duration expires or when the target or the wizard moves more than 10' away from it.

The gate is visible from both sides, and other creatures can reach through the gate. Breath weapons, gaze attacks, missiles, spells, and similar attacks cannot be cast through the gate. Because creatures can pass their limbs through the gate, physical attacks and touch spells can be used.

The only limit to the range of this spell is that the caster and the target must be on the same plane of existence. Elemental forces (not creatures) will not pass through the gate. Thus, the wizard does not run the risk of flooding his laboratory by opening a gate beneath the sea, for example. However, the spell does not provide any sort of protection against a hostile environment.

The material components are an exquisite silver mirror of no less than 10,000 gp value and a black opal worth at least 1,000 gp which must be powdered and sprinkled on the mirror. The mirror is not lost after casting and may be used again, but the powdered opal is consumed in the casting."}</textarea>

"description":"This devious spell distracts the subject creatures by drawing them into an absorbing discussion on topics of interest to them.

These responses are conversation (rounds 1-3), possible confusion (rounds 4-6), and then either rage or lamentation (rounds 7-11). All saving throws are affected by the creatures' Intelligences, as noted later. The subject creatures must be able to understand the language in which the spellcaster speaks.

Upon casting the spell, the wizard begins discussion of some topic germane to the creature or creatures to be affected. Those making a successful saving throw vs. spell are unaffected. Affected creatures immediately begin to converse with the spellcaster, agreeing or disagreeing, all most politely. As long as the spellcaster chooses, he can maintain the spell by conversing with the subject(s). If the caster is attacked or otherwise distracted, the subject creatures do not notice.

The wizard can leave at any time after the casting and the subject(s) continue on as if the caster were still present. As long as they are not attacked, the creatures ignore all else going on around them, spending their time talking and arguing to the exclusion of other activities. However, when the caster leaves, each subject completes only the stage of the spell that it is currently in, and then the spell is broken.

If the caster maintains the spell for more than three rounds, each affected creature can roll another saving throw vs. spell. Those failing to save wander off in confusion for 1d10+2 rounds, staying away from the spellcaster. Those who make this saving throw continue to talk and roll saving throws for each round that the caster continues the spell, up through the sixth round, to avoid the confusion effect.

If the spell is maintained for more than six rounds, each subject must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell to avoid going into a rage, attacking all other subjects of the spell with intent to kill. This rage lasts for 1d4+1 rounds.

"description":"This spell enables a specially constructed chest to be hidden deep within the Ethereal Plane, to be summoned using a small model of the chest. The large chest must be exceptionally well-crafted and expensive, constructed for the caster by master craftsmen. If made principally of wood, it must be ebony, rosewood, sandalwood, teak, or the like, and all of its corner fittings, nails, and hardware must be platinum. If constructed of ivory, the metal fittings of the chest must be gold. If the chest is fashioned from bronze, copper, or silver, its fittings must be electrum or silver. The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, the wizard must have a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail) made, so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. One wizard can have but one pair of these chests at any given time--even wish spells do not allow exceptions! The chests themselves are nonmagical, and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest.

While touching the chest and holding the tiny replica, the caster chants the spell. This causes the large chest to vanish into the Ethereal Plane. The chest can contain 1 cubic foot of material per level of the wizard no matter what its apparent size. Living matter makes it 75% likely that the spell fails, so the chest is typically used for securing valuable spell books, magical items, gems, etc. As long as the spellcaster has the small duplicate of the magical chest, he can recall the large one from the Ethereal Plane whenever the chest is desired. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, not even with a wish spell, that the large chest can return, although an expedition might be mounted to find it.

While the chest is in the Ethereal Plane, there is a cumulative 1% chance per week that some being finds it. This chance is reset to 1% whenever the chest is recalled and the spell recast to return it to the Ethereal Plane. If the chest is found, the DM must work out the encounter and decide how the being reacts to the chest (for example, it might ignore the chest, fully or partially empty it, or even exchange or add to the items present!).

Whenever the secret chest is brought back to the Prime Material Plane, an ethereal window is opened for a variable amount of time (usually about one turn); the window slowly diminishes in size. When this hole opens between the planes, check for an ethereal encounter to see if a monster is drawn through.

If the large chest is not retrieved before the spell duration lapses, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest is lost."}</textarea>

Spells that are to be stored in the staff must be memorized normally by the wizard.

Only wizards who know the magic staff spell can cast spells from another wizard's staff. This applies to wizards who have never learned or could not normally cast the spells stored in a staff.

It is common, however, for the staff&#039;s owner to implement a command word which must be known by anyone wishing to use the staff.<br /><br />The material component for this spell is a staff cut from an ash tree. For each spell level the wizard intends to imbue into the staff, it must be inlaid with rubies worth at least 1000gp.</div>

"description":"The renowned fire wizard Daltim developed this spell some years ago to protect important items or structures against the various incendiary spells with which he was familiar.

This is cumulative with the saving throw bonus of a magical item, so a cloak of protection +4 could have a bonus of +7 to +10 on any item saving throws versus combustion effects. Remember that an item fails its saving throw on a natural roll of 1, regardless of any bonuses.

The item affected must be one discrete construction or object, although it can be articulated or composed of several parts (for example, a suit of armor, a catapult, a house, or a carriage). At 9th level, the wizard can proof an article of clothing or a small piece of furniture; at 12th level, a small vehicle or large piece of furniture; at 15th level, a small building or large vehicle; at 18th level, a medium building or a very large vehicle; and at 20th level or higher, a large building or small fortification.

The eyes are subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect the wizard's ability to receive visual information about his surroundings. The eyes only see as a normal human would-abilities and spell effects including infravision do not alter the eyes' vision. It only takes the eye one round to replay one hour of recorded images.

The spell conjures 1d4 eyes, plus 1 eye per caster level. The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level, or until they return to the wizard; after relaying its findings, an eye disappears. Each eye is AC 16, flies by levitation at a rate of 12,and has only 1 hit point - a single hit from any weapon or damaging spell destroys it. A successful dispel magic destroys all eyes caught in the area of effect. While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they're small and difficult to spot, especially in conditions of poor visibility such as darkness, fog, or rain. Of course, if the eye is being sent into darkness, then it's very possible that it could hit a wall or other similar obstacle and destroy itself.

When the wizard creates the eyes, he can specify any set of instruction or orders that he wishes, up to 25 words. Any knowledge the wizard possesses is assumed to be know by the eyes as well, so if the wizard knows what a typical Jakallian merchant looks like, the eyes do as well. Sample commands might be, \"Surround me at a range of 400 yards and return if you spot any dangerous creatures,\" or \"Spread out and search the town for Arweth; follow him for three turns, staying out of sight, and then return.\" Note that in the first command, the eye only returns if it spots a creature that the wizard would regard as dangerous; a seemingly innocuous peasant that is actually a shapechanged dragon wouldn't trigger the eye's return. In any event, if an eye is ever more than one mile distant from the wizard, it instantly ceases to exist. However, the wizard's link with the eye is such that he won't know if eye was destroyed or if just wandered out of range.  

Some command words can be used to abbreviate the direction. For example, \"surround me\" directs the eyes to form an equally-spaced ring at whatever range is indicated, and then move with the wizard. As eyes return or are destroyed, the rest automatically space themselves to compensate. \"Spread out\" directs the eyes to move away from the wizard in all directions. Other commands that might be useful include having them form a line in a certain manner, making them move at random within a certain range, or have them follow a certain type of creature. The DM is the final judge of the suitability of the wizard's directions.

The material component is a handful of crystal marbles."}</textarea>

"description":"By means of this spell, the wizard is able to move objects by concentrating on moving them mentally. The spell can provide either a gentle, sustained force or a single short, violent thrust.

A sustained force enables the wizard to move a weight of up to 25 pounds a distance up to 20 feet per round. The spell lasts two rounds, plus one round per caster level. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or both. An object moved beyond the caster's range falls or stops. If the caster ceases concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops. The object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. The caster might even be able to untie simple knots, at the discretion of the DM.

Alternatively, the spell energy can be expended in a single round. The caster can hurl one or more objects within range, and within a 10-foot cube, directly away from himself at high speed, to a distance of up to 10 feet per caster level. This is subject to a maximum weight of 25 pounds per caster level. Damage caused by hurled objects is decided by the DM, but cannot exceed 1 point of damage per caster level. Opponents who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. Furthermore, those able to employ as simple a counter-measure as an enlarge spell, for example (thus making the body weight go over the maximum spell limit), can easily counter the spell. The various Bigby's hand spells also counter this spell."}</textarea>

Teleporting high means the wizard arrives 10 feet above the ground for every 1% he is below the lowest \"On Target\" probability; this could be as high as 320 feet if the destination area was never seen.

"description":"By casting this inherently evil spell, the wizard conjures a small amount of deadly poison directly onto any weapon blades or other surface within the area of effect. The spell creates one dose per caster level; a single dose is sufficient to coat one size S weapon such as a dagger or an arrowhead, three doses can coat a size M weapon, and five doses can coat a size L weapon. The venom remains potent for up to one hour per caster level, although an envenomed blade remains so for only 1d3 successful attacks before the poison has been worn off. The potency of the venom varies by the caster level, as shown below.(See book for table).

If a weapon coated with Vandarien's vile venom successfully hits a creature, the victim must make a saving throw vs. poison or suffer the first damage figure - if the caster was a 12th-level wizard, this would be 25 points. (Naturally, this is damage above and beyond any caused by the weapon that injects the poison.) Even if he succeeds in the save, the victim still sustains a lesser amount of damage, as shown in the second figure.

Instead of creating an insinuative poison (one that is introduced to the body through a cut), the wizard can instead conjure the venom as a contact poison. A surface of about one-half square foot per caster level can be affected. One square foot is enough to coat a doorknob, a sword-hilt, the handle or clasp of a chest, or an object of similar size. The contact poison has the same effects as the insinuative venom, but the victim gains a +2 bonus on his saving throws. The contact poison’s toxicity fades at the end of the spell’s duration.

Count every +1 hit point bonus of a creature as ½ of a Hit Die; thus, a creature with 4+3 Hit Dice equals a 4 ½ Hit Dice creature.

				<div class="description-content">The conjure animals spell enables the wizard to magically create one or more mammals to attack his opponents. The total Hit Dice of the mammals cannot exceed twice his level, if determined randomly, or his level if a specific animal type is requested (see the Dungeon Master Guide). Thus, a wizard of 12th level could randomly conjure two mammals with 12 Hit Dice, four with 6 Hit Dice each, six with 4 Hit Dice each, eight with 3 Hit Dice each, twelve with 2 Hit Dice each, or 24 with 1 Hit Die each. Count every +1 hit point bonus of a creature as &frac12; of a Hit Die; thus, a creature with 4+3 Hit Dice equals a 4 &frac12; Hit Dice creature. The conjured animal(s) remain for one round for each level of the conjuring wizard, or until slain. They follow the caster&#039;s verbal commands. Conjured animals unfailingly attack the wizard&#039;s opponents, but they resist being used for any other purpose.</div>

"description":"The control weather spell enables a wizard to change the weather in the local area. The spell affects the weather for 4d6 hours in an area of 4d4 square miles. It requires one turn to cast the spell, and an additional 1d4 turns for the weather conditions to occur. The current weather conditions are decided by the DM, depending on the climate and season.
Weather conditions have three components: precipitation, temperature, and wind. The spell can change these conditions according to the following chart.

The upper-cased headings represent the existing weather conditions. The small headings beneath each large heading are the new conditions to which the caster can change the existing conditions. Furthermore, the caster can control the direction of the wind. For example, a day that is clear and warm with moderate wind can be controlled to become hazy, hot, and calm. Contradictions are not possible--fog and strong wind, for example. Multiple control weather spells can be used only in succession.

The material components for this spell are burning incense and bits of earth and wood mixed in water. Obviously, this spell functions only in areas where there are appropriate climatic conditions."}</textarea>

"description":"This is a spell that must be used by a wizard planning to create a magical item. The enchant an item spell prepares the object to accept the magic. The item must meet the following tests: 1) it must be in sound and undamaged condition; 2) the item must be the finest possible, considering its nature, i.e., crafted of the highest quality material and with the finest workmanship; and 3) its cost or value must reflect the second test, and in most cases the item must have a raw-materials cost in excess of 100gp. With respect to requirement 3, it is not possible to apply this test to items such as ropes, leather goods, cloth, and pottery not normally embroidered, bejeweled, tooled, carved, or engraved. If such work or materials can be added to an item without weakening or harming its normal functions, however, these are required for the item to be enchanted.

The wizard must have access to a workshop or laboratory, properly equipped and from which contaminating magic can be screened. Any magical item not related to the fabrication process (such as most protective devices) and within 30 feet of the materials is a source of contaminating magic and will spoil the process.

The item to be prepared must be touched by the spellcaster. This touching must be constant and continual during the casting time, which is a base 16 hours plus an additional 8d8 hours (as the wizard may never work more than eight hours per day, and haste or any other spells will not alter the time required in any way, this effectively means that casting time for this spell is two days + 1d8 days). All work must be uninterrupted, and during rest periods the item being enchanted must never be more than 1 foot distant from the spellcaster; if it is, the whole spell is spoiled and must be begun again. (Note that during rest periods absolutely no other form of magic can be performed, and the wizard must remain quiet and in isolation or the enchantment is ruined.)

At the end of the spell, the caster will know that the item is ready for the final test. He will then pronounce the final magical syllable, and if the item makes a saving throw (which is exactly the same as that of the wizard) vs. spell, the spell is completed. The spellcaster's saving throw bonuses also apply to the item, up to +3. A result of 1 on the 1d20 roll always results in failure, regardless of modifications. Once the spell is finished, the wizard can begin to place the desired spell upon the item. The spell he plans to place must be cast within 24 hours or the preparatory spell fades, and the item must be enchanted again.

Each spell subsequently cast upon an object bearing an enchant an item spell requires 2d4 hours per spell level of the magic being cast. Again, during casting the item must be touched by the wizard, and during the rest periods it must always be within 1 foot of his
person. This procedure holds true for any additional spells placed upon the item, and each successive spell must be begun within 24 hours o the last, even if the prior spell failed.

No magic placed on an item is permanent unless a permanency spell is used as a finishing touch. This always runs a 5% risk of draining 1 point of Constitution from the wizard casting the spell. Also, while it is possible to tell when the basic spell (enchant an item) succeeds, it is not possible to tell if successive castings actually work, for each must make the same sort of saving throw as the item itself made. Naturally, an item that is charged--a rod, staff, wand, javelin of lightning, ring of wishes, etc.--can never be made permanent. Magical devices cannot be used to enchant an item or cast magic upon an object so prepared, but scrolls can be used for this purpose.

The materials needed for this spell vary according to both the nature of the item being enchanted and the magic to be cast upon it. For example, a cloak of displacement might require the hides of one or more displacer beasts, a sword meant to slay dragons could require the blood and some other part of the type(s) of dragon(s) it will be effective against, and a ring of shooting stars might require pieces of meteorites and the horn of kirin. These specifics, as well as other information pertaining to this spell, are decided by the DM and must be discovered or researched in play.  "}</textarea>

"description":"Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a powerful creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap, where it will be held until it agrees to perform one service in return for freedom from the ensnarement spell. The type of creature to be ensnared must be known and stated, and if it has a specific, proper, or given name, this must be used in casting the ensnarement spell. The spell causes an awareness of a gatelike opening on the plane of the creature to be ensnared. A special saving throw is then made to determine if the creature detects the nature of the planar opening as a trap or believes it to be a gate. To save, the creature must roll equal to or less than its Intelligence score on 1d20. The score is modified by the difference between the creature's Intelligence and that of the spellcaster. If the creature has a higher score, the difference is subtracted from its dice roll to save. If the spellcaster has a higher score, the difference is added to the dice roll.

If the saving throw succeeds, the creature ignores the spell-created opening, and the spell fails. If the saving throw fails, the creature steps into the opening and is ensnared.

When so trapped, the otherplanar creature can freely attack the ensnaring wizard, unless the caster has created a warding circle. Such circles may be temporary (drawn by hand) or permanent (inlaid or carved). Even with such protection, the entrapped creature may break free and wreak its vengeance upon the spellcaster.

A hand-drawn circle has a base failure chance of 20%, while one inlaid or carved has a base of 10% (and that is for the first time it is used, to determine whether or not the job was done properly). The base chance is modified by the difference between the wizard's combined Intelligence and experience level and the Intelligence and the experience level or Hit Dice of the creature ensnared. If the spellcaster has a higher total, that difference in percentage points is subtracted from the chance for the creature to break free. If the creature has a higher total, that difference is added to its chance to break free.

The chance can be further reduced by careful preparation of the circle. If the handmade circle is drawn over a longer period of time, using specially prepared pigments (1,000 gp value per turn spent drawing), the chance of breaking free is reduced by 1% for every turn spent in preparation. This can bring the base chance to 0%.

Similarly, an inlaid or carved design can be brought to a 0% chance of the creature breaking free by inlaying with various metals, minerals, etc. This cost will require a minimum of one full month of time and add not less than 50,000 gp to the basic cost of having the circle inlaid or carved into stone. Any break in the circle spoils the efficacy of the spell and enables the creature to break free automatically. Even a straw dropped across the line of a magic circle destroys its power. Fortunately, the creature within cannot so much as place a straw upon any portion of the inscribed ward, for the magic of the barrier absolutely prevents it.

Once safely ensnared, the creature can be kept for as long as the spellcaster dares. (Remember the danger of something breaking the ward!) The creature cannot leave the circle, nor can any of its attacks or powers penetrate the barrier. The caster can offer bribes, use promises, or make threats in order to exact one service from the captive creature.

The DM will then assign a value to what the wizard has said to the ensnared creature, rating it from 0 to 6 (with 6 being the most persuasive). This rating is then subtracted from the Intelligence score of the creature. If the creature rolls a successful Intelligence check against its adjusted Intelligence, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, etc., can be made, or the old ones re-offered 24 hours later, when the creature's Intelligence has dropped by 1 point due to confinement. This can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until the caster decides to get rid of it by means of some riddance spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to.

Once the single service is completed, the creature need only so inform the spellcaster to be instantly sent from whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a powerful creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap, where it will be held until it agrees to perform one service in return for freedom from the ensnarement spell. The type of creature to be ensnared must be known and stated, and if it has a specific, proper, or given name, this must be used in casting the ensnarement spell. The spell causes an awareness of a gatelike opening on the plane of the creature to be ensnared. A special saving throw is then made to determine if the creature detects the nature of the planar opening as a trap or believes it to be a gate. To save, the creature must roll equal to or less than its Intelligence score on 1d20. The score is modified by the difference between the creature&#039;s Intelligence and that of the spellcaster. If the creature has a higher score, the difference is subtracted from its dice roll to save. If the spellcaster has a higher score, the difference is added to the dice roll.<br /><br />If the saving throw succeeds, the creature ignores the spell-created opening, and the spell fails. If the saving throw fails, the creature steps into the opening and is ensnared.<br /><br />When so trapped, the otherplanar creature can freely attack the ensnaring wizard, unless the caster has created a warding circle. Such circles may be temporary (drawn by hand) or permanent (inlaid or carved). Even with such protection, the entrapped creature may break free and wreak its vengeance upon the spellcaster.<br /><br />A hand-drawn circle has a base failure chance of 20%, while one inlaid or carved has a base of 10% (and that is for the first time it is used, to determine whether or not the job was done properly). The base chance is modified by the difference between the wizard&#039;s combined Intelligence and experience level and the Intelligence and the experience level or Hit Dice of the creature ensnared. If the spellcaster has a higher total, that difference in percentage points is subtracted from the chance for the creature to break free. If the creature has a higher total, that difference is added to its chance to break free.<br /><br />The chance can be further reduced by careful preparation of the circle. If the handmade circle is drawn over a longer period of time, using specially prepared pigments (1,000 gp value per turn spent drawing), the chance of breaking free is reduced by 1% for every turn spent in preparation. This can bring the base chance to 0%.<br /><br />Similarly, an inlaid or carved design can be brought to a 0% chance of the creature breaking free by inlaying with various metals, minerals, etc. This cost will require a minimum of one full month of time and add not less than 50,000 gp to the basic cost of having the circle inlaid or carved into stone. Any break in the circle spoils the efficacy of the spell and enables the creature to break free automatically. Even a straw dropped across the line of a magic circle destroys its power. Fortunately, the creature within cannot so much as place a straw upon any portion of the inscribed ward, for the magic of the barrier absolutely prevents it.<br /><br />Once safely ensnared, the creature can be kept for as long as the spellcaster dares.

"description":"An eyebite spell enables the caster to merely meet the gaze of a creature and speak a single word to cause an effect. This gaze attack is in addition to any other attacks allowed to the wizard. The wizard selects one of four possible gaze attacks at the time the spell is cast, and this attack cannot be changed. For example, a 12th-level caster who chose fear would have four opportunities to make gaze attacks causing fear, one for each round of the spell's duration. Any gaze attack is negated by a successful saving throw vs. spell, with Wisdom adjustments. The four effects of the spell are as follows:

Charm: The wizard can charm a single person or monster by gaze and by uttering a single word. The effect is to make the charmed subject absolutely loyal and docile to the caster, even to the point of personal danger. It is otherwise the same as a charm monster spell. All creatures other than humans, demihumans, and humanoids save with +2 bonuses.

Fear: The wizard can cause fear by gaze and by speaking a single word. The subject flees in blind terror for 1d4 rounds. After this, the creature refuses to face the caster and cowers or bolts for the nearest cover if subsequently confronted by the caster (50% chance of either). The latter effect lasts one turn per caster level. This attack can be negated by spells that counter fear.

Sicken: This power enables the caster to merely gaze, speak, a word, and cause sudden pain and fever to sweep over the subject's body. Creatures with ability scores function at half effectiveness; others inflict only one-half damage with physical attacks. Movement is at one-half normal rate. The subject remains stricken for one turn per level of the caster, after which all abilities return at the rate of one point per turn of complete rest or one point per hour of moderate activity. The effects cannot be negated by a cure disease or heal spell, but a remove curse or successful dispel magic spell is effective. Creatures other than humans, demihumans, and humanoids save with +2 bonuses versus this attack.

Sleep: The wizard can cause any individual to fall into a comatose slumber by means of a gaze and a single word, unless the subject successfully rolls its saving throw vs. spell. Creatures normally subject to a 1st-level sleep spell save with -2 penalties. An affected creature must be shaken or otherwise shocked back to consciousness.

In all cases, the gaze attack has a speed factor of 1. This spell does not affect undead of any type, or extend beyond the plane occupied by the caster. Note that the caster is subject to the effects of his reflected gaze and is allowed any applicable saving throw. In the case of a reflected charm gaze, the caster is paralyzed until it wears off or is countered."}</textarea>

"description":"A more potent form of the lesser sign of sealing, this spell allows the caster to guard an item or portal and prevent all other creatures from opening or passing through the sealed item or surface. The greater sign has several effects; first of all, it affects a doorway or item that opens (a chest, for instance) as a wizard lock spell. If placed in an open corridor or archway to prevent passage, the greater sign creates a magical barrier that repels all who try to pass.

Second, the greater sign greatly strengthens the physical structure of any door or item it is placed upon, granting a +6 bonus on any item saving throws and allowing the item or door to ignore 1 point of damage per caster level from any attack. For example, a greater sign cast by a 12th-level wizard would reduce the damage of any blow or spell by 12 points, so a fighter armed with a broad sword (maximum damage of 8 points) could never hack through a door protected by the sign.

Finally, if the protected doorway or item is forced open or destroyed by any means, the sign itself is not only destroyed, but also releases a spell upon the offending creature. The spell held by the sign is cast into the ward when the greater sign is created, and any spell the caster has memorized may be used in this way, from a fireball or shocking grasp to a very nasty wish or polymorph. The range of the sign's retributive spell is 10 yards per caster level, so it is possible to destroy the warding from a safe distance.

The sign is displayed in plain sight, and most wizards will recognize it for what it is. The caster cannot specify particular creatures or conditions for the sign’s operation; it functions against any creature that attempts to pass it, although the wizard can freely pass through his own sign without activating it. The greater sign can be removed by the caster, thus ending the spell, or it can be defeated by a limited wish or wish spell cast by a wizard of equal or higher level than the original caster; it cannot be dispelled.

The material component for a greater sign is a powdered diamond worth at least 1,000gp."}</textarea>

"description":"The legend lore spell is used to determine legendary information regarding a known person, place, or thing. If the person or thing is at hand, or if the wizard is in the place in question, the likelihood of the spell producing results is far greater and the casting time is only 1d4 turns. If only detailed information on the person, place, or thing is known, casting time is 1d10 days. If only rumors are known, casting time is 2d6 weeks.

During the casting, the wizard cannot engage in activities other than the routine: eating, sleeping, etc. When completed, the divination reveals if legendary material is available. It often reveals where this material is--by place name, rhyme, or riddle. It sometimes gives certain information regarding the person, place, or thing (when the object of the legend lore is at hand), but this data is always in some cryptic form (rhyme, riddle, anagram, cipher, sign, etc.). Naturally, a legend lore spell reveals information only if the person, place, or thing is noteworthy or legendary.

For example, suppose Delsenora came across an extremely well-made sword. It radiates magic, but when she used an identify spell, she could not learn any information. Even giving it to a trusted fighter didn't work, as the sword did not reveal any special powers. Finally, she casts a legend lore spell, hoping to gain more information. Since the sword is at hand, she completes the spell in three turns. In her mind comes the message, \"Once this was the sword of he who waits till Albion's time of greatest peril, when unto his hand it shall fly again. Fair was the hand that gave me and fair was the hand that reclaimed me.\" Clearly, Delsenora realizes, this must be a very powerful item, since her spell gave only a cryptic answer. But who is he who waits? And where is Albion? For more information, Delsenora is going to have to cast more spells. But now the process will take much longer, since she has only the vaguest of clues to follow.

The legend lore spell is cast with incense and strips of ivory formed into a rectangle, but some item of value to the caster must be sacrificed in addition--a potion, magical scroll, magical item, etc."}</textarea>

"description":"The magic of this spell is similar to that of the vacancy spell, only more powerful and elaborate. The spell enables the caster to make an area appear to be something other than it is - a setting he has personally seen. The spell remains as long as the caster maintains a minimal concentration upon it. Even after this, the spell persists for a total of one hour plus one additional turn for each experience level of the caster. (Note: Minimal concentration can be maintained during normal conversation but not while spellcasting, in melee, or if harmed by an attack.) If the caster actually uses a small bit of anything connected with the place to create this spell, it takes on a quasi reality.

In its basic form, forceful contact is necessary to have any hope of discovering the magic, short of a detection device or spell. In its more complex form, where a material component is used, detection is possible only by some magical means, whether device, item, or spell. Either form of mirage arcana is subject to the dispel magic spell.

As with all powerful illusions, the mind of the believer urges appropriate effects upon the viewer's body. Under the influence of the spell, the viewer could possibly walk across a bed of hot coals thinking it was a shallow stream of water that was cooling his feet (and thus suffer no damage), dine upon imaginary food and actually be satisfied, or rest comfortably upon a bed of sharp stones, thinking it a featherbed. Gravity is not affected by the spell, however, so an envisioned bridge spanning a deep chasm does not support the believer. Those who witness the event see it as a sudden disappearance of the individual. They do not connect it with an illusion unless they are otherwise aware of some magic at work."}</textarea>

Thus, embankments can be collapsed, hillocks moved, dunes shifted, etc. However, in no event can rock prominences be collapsed or moved. The area to be affected dictates the casting time; for every 40 yard x 40 yard surface area and 10 feet of depth, one turn of casting time is required. The maximum area that can be affected is 240 yards x 240 yards, which takes four hours.

If terrain features are to be moved--as compared to simply caving in banks or walls of earth--it is necessary that an earth elemental be subsequently summoned to assist. All spell casting or summoning must be completed before any effects occur. As any summoned earth elemental will perform most of its work underground, it is unlikely that it will be intercepted or interrupted. Should this occur, however, the movement of the earth requiring its services must be stopped until the elemental is once again available. Should the elemental be slain or dismissed, the move earth spell is limited to collapsing banks or walls of earth. The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or bury creatures; its primary use is for digging or filling moats or for adjusting terrain contours before a battle.

The material components for this spell are a mixture of soils (clay, loam, sand) in a small bag and an iron blade.

Note: This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacierlike fluidity until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations, etc. are relatively unaffected, save for changes in elevation and relative topography."}</textarea>

"description":"Otiluke's Freezing Sphere is a multipurpose spell of considerable power. If the caster opts, he may create any of the following:

A) Frigid globe. A small globe of matter at absolute zero temperature that spreads upon contact with water, or a liquid that is principally water, freezing it to a depth of 6 inches over an area equal to 100 square feet per level of the spellcaster. This ice lasts for one round per level of the caster.

The material component is a thin sheet of crystal about an inch square.

B) Cold ray. The spell can be used as a thin ray of cold that springs from the caster's hand to a distance of 10 yards per level of the wizard; this ray inflicts 1d4+2 points of damage per level of the caster upon the first creature struck. A saving throw vs. spell is applicable; all damage is negated if it is successful (as the ray is so narrow a save indicates it missed). If the first creature is missed, the path of the ray is plotted to its full distance, and anything else in its path must save (if applicable) or suffer appropriate damage.

The material component is a white sapphire of not less than 1,000gp value.

C) Globe of cold. This creates a small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, but not harmful. This globe can be hurled, either by hand to a distance of 40 yards (considered short range), or as a sling bullet. The globe shatters upon impact, inflicting 6d6 points of cold damage upon all creatures within a 10-foot radius (one-half damage if a saving throw vs. spell is successful). Use the Grenadelike Missile Table in the Dungeon Master Guide to find where misses strike. Note that if the globe is not thrown or slung within one round per level of the spellcaster, it shatters and causes cold damage as stated above. This timed effect can be employed against pursuers, although it can prove hazardous to the spellcaster and his associates as well.

The material component is a 1,000gp diamond."}</textarea>

"description":"To prepare for this spell, the caster must build a very hot fire. This can be through making a large fire, or a small fire of materials that burn very hot. The caster must also have an amount of sand on hand. Once the fire has reached the required intensity, the caster imbues a handful of sand with the magic of the spell and tosses it into the flames where they are quickly and brightly incinerated in an instant, and altering the flames to act as a window into the past. 

Any who look upon the flames will see the same event or location as if viewed through a window whose shape flickers with the flame. The caster chooses a location and a time when enchanting the first handful of sand, and can change location and time with each subsequent imbued handful they add to the fire.

The location must be public, something generally accessible to anyone, unless the caster adds to the fire a flammable personal affect of a specific person whose past they wish to view. The item should be relatively whole and personal in nature. Alternatively, a drop of blood or the root of a hair, freshly procured in the last 24 hours, may be used in lieu of a personal item. The location can be changed with a handful of sand. Regardless whether the caster is viewing a public area, or a specific person, a room lined with lead or silver will block the spell and the caster will see nothing but flames.

The time frame is limited to the past, viewed in real time, and limited to increments of exactly 1 year. Should a caster wish to view the events of the previous day, they would have to wait a year minus a day to see them. The time may be changed with a handful of sand to any increment of 1 year that they wish.

Postcognition can be channeled for as long as the caster is no more than 15 from the flames, their intensity is maintained, and the caster maintains concentration on the spell. They may converse with those around them as long as it is about what is happening in the fires. Other conversation is too distracting and will cause the caster to falter. Taking damage requires making a saving throw to maintain concentration.

Because the onlooker sees the events only where flames are, one bigger or closer the flames, the better view the onlooker will have. Frequent users of this spell often have singed hairs and small burns on themselves, as well as a distant and unchanging gaze that feels removed from the world."}</textarea>

"description":"The stone to flesh spell turns any sort of stone into flesh. If the recipient stone object was formerly living, this spell restores life (and goods), although the survival of the creature is subject to the usual system shock survival roll. Any formerly living creature, regardless of size, can be thus returned to flesh. Ordinary stone can be turned to flesh in a volume of 9 cubic feet per level of experience of the spellcaster. Such flesh is inert, lacking a vital life force, unless a life force or magical energy is available (for example, this spell would turn a stone golem into a flesh golem, but an ordinary statue would become a body). If cast upon stone, the wizard can create a cylinder of fleshy material from 1 to 3 feet in diameter and up to 10 feet long, allowing a passage to be made.

The material components are a pinch of earth and a drop of blood.

The reverse, flesh to stone, turns flesh of any sort to stone. All possessions on the person of the creature likewise turn to stone. The intended subject of the spell receives a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If a statue created by this spell is subjected to breakage or weathering, the being (if ever returned to his original, fleshy state) will have similar damage, deformities, etc. The DM may allow such damage to be repaired by various high-level clerical spells, such as regenerate.

The material components of the spell are lime, water, and earth."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">The stone to flesh spell turns any sort of stone into flesh. If the recipient stone object was formerly living, this spell restores life (and goods), although the survival of the creature is subject to the usual system shock survival roll. Any formerly living creature, regardless of size, can be thus returned to flesh. Ordinary stone can be turned to flesh in a volume of 9 cubic feet per level of experience of the spellcaster. Such flesh is inert, lacking a vital life force, unless a life force or magical energy is available (for example, this spell would turn a stone golem into a flesh golem, but an ordinary statue would become a body). If cast upon stone, the wizard can create a cylinder of fleshy material from 1 to 3 feet in diameter and up to 10 feet long, allowing a passage to be made.<br /><br />The material components are a pinch of earth and a drop of blood.<br /><br />The reverse, flesh to stone, turns flesh of any sort to stone. All possessions on the person of the creature likewise turn to stone. The intended subject of the spell receives a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If a statue created by this spell is subjected to breakage or weathering, the being (if ever returned to his original, fleshy state) will have similar damage, deformities, etc. The DM may allow such damage to be repaired by various high-level clerical spells, such as regenerate.<br /><br />The material components of the spell are lime, water, and earth.</div>

"description":"When this spell is cast, the wizard designates one inanimate object of stone, earth, or metal within the spell's range to function as a powerful magnet, attracting all metal. The object affected can be no larger than a 10-feet cube, although a section of wall, floor, or ceiling about 10 square feet will work. Once magnetized, the object exerts a powerful attractive or repulsive force(caster's choice) against objects of ferrous metal. The effects vary by the proximity of the metal objects to the center of magnetism, as shown below .See book for table. 

The movement rate represent how fast objects are drawn to or repelled from the center of magnetism. If the creature or object in question is heavier than the magnetized item, the magnetized item does the moving instead. The effective strength is the pull of the magnetism at that range; the size equivalent refers to creature sizes, not weapons sizes. A character or creature carrying loose metal items or objects such as weapons, shields, helms, buttons, and so on must win opposed strength check  (see player option: combat& tactics for information on opposed ability checks) in order to keep his possessions from being wrenched out of his grasp by the magnetism. Securing a weapon in its sheath, holding an item with both hands, and other precautions may give the character a +2 to +4 to his base ability score, at the DM's discretion.

Characters wearing metal armor must attempt an opposed strength check to ignore the effects of the magnetism. If the character fails his strength check outright, he loses his footing and flies towards or away from the object at the full rate indicated. He suffers full falling damage based on the speed with which he hits the item- 1d6 for every 10 feet of the movement rate, or half that ground if the character passes his strength check but is beaten by the magnetism roll, he is moved one foot for each point he lost by. Again, some precautions or assistance may help iron wearing characters in their strength checks. For monsters, compare the creature's size to the effective size of magnetism.

An armored character who is stuck to a surface or object loses any dexterity adjustments to AC and cannot make any physical attacks. He can try to wriggle out of his armor and free himself, employ a magical item, or use psionic powers if he has any at his disposal.

The material component for this spell is a small bar magnet, bent into a u-shape and coated with mithril."}</textarea>

The caster must both name the type of creature(s) to be sent away and give its name and title as well, if any. In any event, the creature's magic resistance must be overcome for the spell to be effective.

The material components of the spell are substances harmful, hateful, or opposed to the nature of the subject(s) of the spell. For every such substance included in the casting, the subject creature(s) loses 5% from its magic resistance and suffers a -2 penalty to its saving throw vs. spell. For example, if iron, holy water, sunstone, and a sprig of rosemary were used in casting a banishment upon a being that hates those things, its saving throw versus the spell would be made with a -8 penalty (four substances times the factor of -2). Special items, such as hair from the tail of a ki-rin or couatl feathers, could also be added to change the factor to -3 or -4 per item. In contrast, a titan's hair or mistletoe blessed by a druid might lower the factor to -1 with respect to the same creature. If the subject creature successfully rolls its saving throw vs. spell, the caster is stung by a backlash of energy, suffers 2d6 points of damage, and is stunned for one round."}</textarea>

"description":"When this spell is cast, the wizard teleports some desired item from virtually any location directly to his hand. The single object can be no longer in any dimension than a sword, can have no more weight than a shield (about eight pounds), and must be nonliving.

To prepare this spell, the wizard must hold a gem of not less than 5,000gp value in his hand and utter all but the final word of the conjuration. At some point in the future, he must crush the gem and utter the final word. The desired item is then transported instantly into the spellcaster's right or left hand, as he desires.

The item must have been previously touched during the initial incantation and specifically named; only that particular item is summoned by the spell. During the initial incantation, the gem becomes magically inscribed with the name of the item to be summoned. The inscription is invisible and unreadable, except by means of a read magic spell, to all but the wizard who cast the summons.

If the item is in the possession of another creature, the spell does not work, and the caster knows who the possessor is and roughly where he, she, or it is located when the summons is cast. Items can be summoned from other planes of existence, but only if such items are not in the possession (not necessarily the physical grasp) of another creature. For each level of experience above the 14th, the wizard is able to summon a desired item from one plane farther removed from the plane he is in at the time the spell is cast (one plane away at 14th level, two planes away at 15th, etc.). Thus, a wizard of 16th level could cast the spell even if the desired item was on the second layer of one of the Outer Planes, but at 14th level the wizard would be able to summon the item only if it were no farther than one of the Inner Planes, the Ethereal Plane, or the Astral Plane (see the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set). Note that special wards or barriers, or factors that block the teleport or plane shift spells, may also block the operation of this spell. Objects in Leomund's secret chest cannot be recovered by using this spell.

Note: If the item is wizard marked, it can be summoned from anywhere on the same plane unless special local conditions apply. Furthermore, the details of the location of the item are more specific, and the item is more easily traceable with other types of scrying magic."}</textarea>

The affected creatures retain their bonus hit points until the normal expiration of the spell that summoned them.<br /><br />The material components are a small leather pouch and a miniature silver candelabra.</div>

This spray is 70 feet long and spreads to 15 feet wide at the end. It includes all colors of the visible spectrum; each ray has a different power and purpose. Any creature with fewer than 8 Hit Dice struck by a ray is blinded for 2d4 rounds, regardless of any other effect.

Any creature in the area of effect will be touched by one or more of the rays. To determine which ray strikes a creature, roll 1d8 and consult the following table:

1 = red
2 = orange
3 = yellow
4 = green
5 = blue
6 = indigo
7 = violet
8 = struck by two rays, roll again twice (ignoring any 8s)

Color  Order  Effect
Red    1st    Inflicts 20 points of damage, save vs. spell for half.
Orange 2nd    Inflicts 40 points of damage, save vs. spell for half.
Yellow 3rd    Inflicts 80 points of damage, save vs. spell for half.
Green  4th    Save vs. poison or die; survivors suffer 20 points of poison damage.
Blue   5th    Save vs. petrification or be turned to stone.
Indigo 6th    Save vs. wand or go insane.
Violet 7th    Save vs. spell or be sent to another plane."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell conjures into existence seven magical orbs that float above the caster’s head in a ring about 5 feet in diameter. The eyes remain for 1 round per level, or until the caster chooses to either expend the orb by using it in attack or defense. In addition, as long as at least one eye is still in existence, the caster gains 360° vision and can detect invisibility and detect phase at will, with a 60-foot range. The powers of each eye are described below.

Eye of the Mind. This orb protects the caster against mental attack, charm, or influence, including charm, beguiling, hold, and emotion effects. The first such attack is negated by the orb and destroys it in turn. If the wizard desires, the eye of the mind can instead be used to charm person like the 1st-level wizard spell, although this also expends the orb.

Eye of the Sword. This eye deflects the first physical attack that endangers the caster, including hand-held or missile attacks, and then disappears. The wizard can also employ the eye of the sword to create five magical blades that strike as magic missiles for 1d4+1 points of damage each. (Knockdown d6, medium (1 hit) impact)

Eye of the Mage. One manifestation of raw energy, such as lightning, fire, force, cold, or a similar effect, is absorbed by the eye of the mage. The eye can also project a 60-foot long by 5-foot wide lightning bolt that inflicts 4d8 damage (saving throw vs. spell for half damage) to all in its path. Either use expends the eye’s power. (Knockdown d12, large (1-3 hits) electricity)

Eye of Venom. This eye can be used to halt any one attack or effect that could poison the caster. In the case of an attacker armed with an envenomed weapon, the caster may decide to expend either the eye of venom or the eye of swords in order to block the attack. The eye can also be used to poison one creature within 30 feet; the victim must make a saving throw vs. poison or die in one round.

Eye of the Spirit. The first attack that affects the victim’s life energy, including energy drain, strength drain, cause wounds, trap the soul, magic jar, or death is parried by the eye of the spirit. The wizard may instead choose to expend the eye’s power by casting enervation (see the 4th-level wizard spell) upon one target within 30 feet.

Eye of Artifice. This eye deflects and is destroyed by the first attack directed at the caster from a magical device. If the attack also takes a form that may be blocked by another eye (for example, the bolt from a wand of lightning) the caster may choose which eye is expended. If used to attack instead, the eye of artifice functions as a dispel magic cast at 8th level.

Eye of Stone. This eye offers protection against the first attack that could petrify the caster and then vanishes. It can also be expended to cast hold person.

Although any number of eyes can defend the wizard in the course of a single round, only one eye may be used to attack per round. When the caster uses an eye to attack, he may not cast a spell, attack physically, or employ another magical item in the same round; willing the eye to discharge its energies requires his complete concentration. Eye attacks are considered to have an initiative modifier of 1 or a speed of very fast in the Player’s Option: Combat & Tactics initiative system.

The material component is seven blessed gemstones worth at least 50gp each."}</textarea>

Any creatures touched by the wizard when shadow walk is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Demiplane of Shadow.

At all times the simulacrum remains under the absolute command of the wizard who created it. No special telepathic link exists, so command must be exercised in some other manner. The spell creates the form of the creature, but it is only a zombielike creation. A reincarnation spell must be used to give the duplicate a vital force, and a limited wish spell must be used to empower the duplicate with 40% to 65% (35% + 5 to 30%) of the knowledge and personality of the original. The level of the simulacrum, if any, is from 20% to 50% of that of the original creature.

The duplicate creature is formed from ice or snow. The spell is cast over the rough form and some piece of the creature to be duplicated must be placed inside the snow or ice. Additionally, the spell requires powdered ruby.

The simulacrum has no ability to become more powerful; it cannot increase its level or abilities. If destroyed, it reverts to snow and melts into nothingness. Damage to the simulacrum can be repaired by a complex process requiring at least one day, 100 gp per hit point, and a fully equipped laboratory."}</textarea>

This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but specifically excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the protected wizard, spell effects delivered by touch, and spell effects from devices such as wands, staves, etc. Thus, a light spell cast to blind the protected wizard could be turned back upon and possibly blind the caster, while the same spell would be unaffected if cast to light an area within which the protected wizard is standing.

From seven to ten spell levels are affected by the turning. The exact number is secretly rolled by the DM; the player never knows for certain how effective the spell is.

A spell may be only partially turned--divide the number of remaining levels that can be turned by the spell level of the incoming spell to see what fraction of the effect is turned, with the remainder affecting the caster. For example, an incoming fireball is centered on a wizard with one level of spell turning left. This means that 2/3 of the fireball affects the protected wizard, 1/3 affects the caster, and each is the center of a fireball effect. If the rolled damage is 40 points, the protected wizard receives 27 points of damage and the caster suffers 13. Both (and any creatures in the respective areas) can roll saving throws vs. spell for half damage. A partially turned hold or paralysis spell will act as a slow spell on those who are 50% or more affected.

If the protected wizard and a spellcasting attacker both have spell turning effects operating, a resonating field is created that has the following effects: See book for table.

"description":"When a statue spell is cast, the wizard or other creature is apparently turned to solid stone, along with any garments and equipment worn or carried. The initial transformation from flesh to stone requires one full round after the spell is cast.

During the transformation, there's an 18% chance that the targeted creature suffers a system shock failure and dies. The creature must roll percentile dice and add its Constitution score to the roll. If the total is 18 or less, the creature dies. If the total is 19 or more, the creature survives the transformation; the creature can withstand any inspection and appear to be a stone statue, although faint magic is detected from the stone if someone checks for it. Note that a creature with a Constitution of 18 or more will always survive the transformation.

Despite being in this condition, the petrified individual can see, hear, and smell normally. Feeling is limited to those sensations that can affect the granite-hard substance of the individual's body--i.e., chipping is equal to a slight wound, but breaking off one of the statue's arms is serious damage.

The individual under the magic of a statue spell can return to his normal state instantly, act, and then return to the statue state, if he so desires, as long as the spell duration is in effect.

"description":"  This spell allows the wizard to set certain vibrations to emanate from an object or location that tend to either repel or attract a specific type of intelligent creature or characters of a particular alignment. The wizard must decide which effect is desired with regard to what creature type or alignment before beginning the spellcasting, for the components of each application differ. The spell cannot be cast upon living creatures.
  Antipathy: This spell causes the affected creature or alignment type to feel an overpowering urge to leave the area or to not touch the affected item. If a saving throw vs. spell is successful, the creature can stay in the area or touch the item, but the creature will feel very uncomfortable, and a persistent itching will cause it to suffer the loss of 1
point of Dexterity per round (for the spell's duration), subject to a maximum loss of 4 points and a minimum Dexterity of 3. Failure to save vs. spell forces the being to abandon the area or item, shunning it permanently and never willingly returning to it until the spell is removed or expires.
  The material component for this application of the spell is a lump of alum soaked in vinegar.
  Sympathy: By casting the sympathy application of the spell, the wizard can cause a particular type of creature or alignment of character to feel elated and pleased to be in an area or touching or possessing an object or item. The desire to stay in the area or touch the object is overpowering. Unless a saving throw vs. spell is successfully rolled, the creature or character will stay or refuse to release the object. If the saving throw is successful, the creature or character is released from the enchantment, but a subsequent saving throw must be made 1d6 turns later. If this saving throw fails, the affected creature will return to the area or object.
  The material components of this spell are 1,000 gp worth of crushed pearls and a drop
of honey.
  Note that the particular type of creature to be affected must be named specifically--for example, red dragons, hill giants, wererats, lammasu, catoblepas, vampires, etc. Likewise, the specific alignment must be named--for example, chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful neutral, true neutral, etc.
  If this spell is cast upon an area, a 10-foot cube can be enchanted for each experience level of the caster. If an object or item is enchanted, only that single thing can be enchanted; affected creatures or characters save vs. spell with a -2 penalty. "}</textarea>

"description":"  A binding spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature, usually from another plane of existence. Extraplanar creatures must be confined by a circular diagram; other creatures can be physically confined. The duration of the spell depends upon the form of the binding and the level of the caster(s), as well as the length of time the spell is actually
uttered. The components vary according to the form of the spell, but they include a continuous chanting utterance read from the scroll or book page giving the spell; gestures appropriate to the form of binding; and materials such as miniature chains of special metal (silver for lycanthropes, etc.), soporific herbs of the rarest sort, a corundum or diamond gem of great size (1,000 gp value per Hit Die of the subject creature), and a vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be captured.
  Magic resistance applies unless the subject's true name is used. A saving throw is not applicable as long as the experience level of the caster is at least twice as great as the Hit Dice of the subject. The caster's level can be augmented by one-third of the levels of each assisting wizard of 9th level or higher, and by one level for each assistant of 4th through 8th level. No more than six other wizards can assist with this spell. If the caster's level is less than twice the Hit Dice of the subject, the subject gains a saving throw vs. spell, modified by the form of binding being attempted. The various forms of binding are:
  Chaining: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except the caster. Duration is as long as one year per level of the caster(s). The subject of this form of binding (as well as in the slumber and bound slumber versions) remains within the restraining barrier.
  Slumber: Brings a comatose sleep upon the subject for a duration of up to one year per level of the caster(s).
  Bound Slumber: A combination of chaining and slumber that lasts for up to one month per level of the caster(s).
  Hedged Prison: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means until freed. The spell remains until the magical hedge is somehow broken.
  Metamorphosis: Causes the subject to change to some noncorporeal form, save for its head or face. The binding is permanent until some prescribed act frees the subject.
 Minimus Containment: The subject is shrunken to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within the hedged prison of some gem or similar object. The subject of a minimus containment, metamorphosis, or hedged prison radiates a very faint aura of magic. 
  The subject of the chaining form of the spell receives a saving throw with no modifications. However, slumber allows the subject a +1 bonus, bound slumber a +2 bonus, hedged prison a +3 bonus, metamorphosis a +4 bonus, and minimus containment a +5 bonus to the saving throw. If the subject is magically weakened, the DM can assign a -1, -2, or even -4 penalty to the saving throw. A successful saving throw enables the subject to burst its bonds and do as it pleases.
  A binding spell can be renewed in the case of the first three forms of the spell, for the subject does not have the opportunity to break the bonds. (If anything has caused a weakening of a chaining or slumber version, such as attempts to contact the subject or magically touch it, a normal saving throw applies to the renewal of the spell.) Otherwise, after one year, and each year thereafter, the subject gains a normal saving throw vs. the spell. Whenever it is successful, the binding spell is broken and the creature is free."}</textarea>

"description":"  This powerful spell allows a caster to transfer a large area of land in the Prime Material plane to any of the elemental planes. All buildings, people, and wildlife within the area of effect are also transported. The land forms a pocket of the Prime Material plane within the elemental plane. The pocket is a sphere with a diameter equal to the diameter of the land. The surface of the pocket allows creatures to enter or exit the pocket, but prevents the elements from entering the pocket.
  Inside the pocket, the land is surrounded by air of a temperature matching that of the Prime Material plane at the moment the land was moved. In addition, a source of water is created within the pocket.
  Before the spell is cast, the area to be moved must be surrounded by solid markers of material from the destination plane.Thus,if a wizard wants to move his castle to the Elemental plane of Fire,he must first surround the area with solid blocks of matter from the elemental plane of Fire; such as hardened magma or magically crystallized fire.The blocks must be spaced no more than five feet apart and may be placed above ground or under surface(at a depth of no more than three fee).
  The wizard must be within the area to be moved when he casts the spell. When the land moves, a hemispherical crater is left behind in the Prime Material plane. Inside its pocket on the desired plane, the land continues its existence as if
nothing changed, with the exception of occasional visits from planar creatures.
  Any land that is moved in this manner can never again be moved with this spell.
  The material component (in addition to the markers) is the appropriate magical device to control elementals of the desired plane (bowl commanding water elementals, brazier commanding fire elementals, censer controlling air elementals, or stone controlling earth elementals). The item must be permanently placed at the heart of the area of effect and cannot be used for any other purpose. If the device is disturbed in any way, the spell immediately fails, allowing the energies of the elemental plane to flood into the protected area."}</textarea>

"description":"This version of the Permanency spell allows magical effects to be made permanent upon creatures or objects. The wizard casts the desired spell and then follows it with the permanency spell. This application of permanency can be dispelled only by a wizard of greater level than the spellcaster was when he cast the spell. Each casting of Greater Permanency reduces the wizard's constitution by 1 point. 

The personal spells upon which a permanency is known to be effective are as follows: comprehend languages, detect evil, detect invisibility, detect magic, infravision, protection from cantrips, protection from evil, protection from normal missiles, read magic, tongues, unseen servant. These spells may not be made permanent upon other creatures.

In addition to personal use, the permanency spell can be used to make the following object/creature or area-effect spells permanent: enlarge, fear, gust of wind, invisibility, magic mouth, prismatic sphere, stinking cloud, wall of fire, wall of force, web.

Additionally, the following spells can be cast upon objects or areas only and be rendered permanent: alarm, audible glamer, dancing lights, solid fog, wall of fire, distance distortion, teleport.

These applications to other spells allow it to be cast simultaneously with any of the latter when no living creature is the target, but the entire spell complex then can be dispelled normally, and thus negated. At the DM's option, permanency might become unstable or fail after a long period of at least 1,000 years. Unstable effects might operate intermittently or fail altogether.

The DM may allow other selected spells to be made permanent. Researching this possible application of a spell costs as much time and money as independently researching the selected spell. If the DM has already determined that the application is not possible, the research automatically fails. Note that the wizard never learns what is possible except by the success or failure of his research."}</textarea>

Spells or attacks that affect the subject's physiology or respiration-for example, poison, cloud kill, enfeeblement, contagion or vain touch-fail completely, since the caster has no physiology or respiration while the spell is in effect. Also, spells that have weight limits should be applied to the wizard as if he weighed over 3000 pounds. The wizard ignores electrical attacks and saves at +4 against fire attacks.

Unfortunately,his movement becomes slow and awkward, so he is reduced to a move of 3 and suffers a -2 penalty to his initiative rolls.Most importantly, the wizard's clumsiness and lack of breath prevent him from casting any spells while the iron body is in effect.
  Iron body may create additional hazards for the wizard as the DM deems appropriate. For example,rust monsters are extremely dangerous to a wizard using this spell.Heat metal spells inflict double damage to the caster, And, naturally, the wizard sinks like a stone in water-although he could survive the crushing pressure and lack of air at the bottom of the ocean-at least until the spell expired.Some magical items, such as potions or winded instruments, may be temporarily unusable as well.
  The material component for this spell is a small piece of iron that once belonged to an iron golem.

These monsters appear in 1d3 rounds within the spell&#039;s area of effect and attack the caster&#039;s opponents, until either he commands them to cease, the spell duration expires, or the monsters are slain. These creatures do not check morale, and they vanish when slain. If no opponent exists to fight, summoned monsters can, if the wizard can communicate with them, and if they are physically capable, perform other services for the summoning wizard.<br />  The material components of this spell are a tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit)candle.</div>

"description":"  This spell changes one object or creature into another. When used as a polymorph other or stone to flesh spell, simply treat the spell as a more powerful version, with saving throws made with -4 penalties to the die roll. When it is cast in order to change other objects, the duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its enchanted state, as well as how different it is in size. The DM determines the changes by using the following guidelines:See book for table.
  A change in kingdom makes the spell work for hours (if removed by one kingdom) or turns (if removed by two). Other changes likewise affect spell duration. Thus, changing a lion to an androsphinx would be permanent, but turning a turnip to a purple worm would be a change with a duration measured in hours. Turning a tusk into an elephant would be
permanent, but turning a twig into a sword would be a change with a duration of several turns.
  All polymorphed objects radiate a strong magic, and if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon them, they return to their natural form. Note that a stone to flesh spell or its reverse will affect objects under this spell. As with other polymorph spells, damage sustained in the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed
creature.
  For example, it is possible to polymorph a creature into rock and grind it to dust, causing damage, perhaps even death. If the creature was changed to dust to start with, more creative methods to damage it would be needed; perhaps the wizard could use a gust of wind spell to scatter the dust far and wide. In general, damage occurs when the
new form is altered through physical force, although the DM will have to adjudicate many of these situations.
  The system shock roll must be applied to living creatures, as must the restrictions noted regarding the polymorph other and stone to flesh spells. Also note that a polymorph effect often detracts from an item's or creature's powers, but does not add new powers, except possibly movement capabilities not present in the old form. Thus, a vorpal sword polymorphed into a dagger would not retain vorpal capability. Likewise, valueless items cannot be made into permanent valuable items.
  The material components of this spell are mercury, gum arabic, and smoke."}</textarea>

"description":"  By means of this spell, a wizard can force a creature or object into the very earth or floor upon which it stands. When casting the spell, the wizard must chant the spell for the remainder of the round without interruption. At that juncture, the subject creature or object becomes rooted to the spot unless a saving throw vs. spell (for a creature) or disintegration (for an object with magical properties) is successful. (Note: \"magical properties\" include those of magical items as listed in the Dungeon Master Guide, those of items enchanted or otherwise of magical origin, and those of items with protection type spells or with permanent magical properties or similar spells upon them.) Items of a nonmagical nature are not entitled to a saving throw. If a subject fails its saving throw, it becomes of slightly greater density than the surface upon which it stands.

				<div class="description-content">  By means of this spell, a wizard can force a creature or object into the very earth or floor upon which it stands. When casting the spell, the wizard must chant the spell for the remainder of the round without interruption. At that juncture, the subject creature or object becomes rooted to the spot unless a saving throw vs. spell (for a creature) or disintegration (for an object with magical properties) is successful. (Note: &quot;magical properties&quot; include those of magical items as listed in the Dungeon Master Guide, those of items enchanted or otherwise of magical origin, and those of items with protection type spells or with permanent magical properties or similar spells upon them.) Items of a nonmagical nature are not entitled to a saving throw.

Affected creatures submit to the demands of any opponent--for example, surrender, get out, etc. The hopelessness lasts for 3d4 turns; during this period it is 25% probable that affected creatures take no action during any round, and 25% likely that those taking action turn back or retire from battle, as applicable.
   Insanity One or more creatures whose total hit points do not exceed 120 become insane and remain so, acting as if a confusion spell had been placed upon them, until a heal, restoration, or wish spell is used to remove the
madness. 
    Pain All creatures are afflicted with wracking pains shooting through their bodies, causing a -2 penalty to Dexterity and a -4 penalty to attack rolls for 2d10 turns.
    Sleep All creatures under 8+1 Hit Dice immediately fall into a catatonic slumber and cannot be awakened for 1d12+4 turns
     Stunning One or more creatures whose total hit points do not exceed 160 are stunned and reeling for 3d4 rounds, dropping anything they are holding. The type of symbol cannot be recognized without being read and thus activating its

"description":"  This spell forces the creature's life force (and its material body) into a special prison gem enchanted by the spellcaster. The creature must be seen by the caster when the final word is uttered.
  The spell can be triggered in one of two ways. First, the final word of the spell can be spoken when the creature is within spell range. This allows magic resistance (if any) and a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the creature's real name is spoken as well, any magic resistance is ignored and the saving throw vs. spell suffers a penalty of -2. If the saving throw is successful, the prison gem shatters.
  The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the victim into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature's soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature's true name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger item when the gem is enchanted. A sympathy spell can also be
placed on the trigger item. As soon as the subject creature picks up or accepts the trigger item, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem, without the benefit of magic resistance or saving throw.
   The gem prison will hold the trapped entity indefinitely, or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, allowing the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane (which could mean a character trapped by an inhabitant of another plane when the character is not on the Prime Material Plane), it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.
   Before the actual casting of the trap the soul spell, the wizard must prepare the prison, a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit Die or level of experience possessed by the creature to be trapped (for example, it requires a gem of 10,000 gp value to trap a 10 Hit Die or 10th-level creature). If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the entrapment is attempted. (Note that while characters have no concept of level as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that this value can change over time as characters advance.) Creating the prison gem requires an enchant an item spell and the placement of a maze spell into the gem, thereby forming the prison to contain the life force."}</textarea>

"description":"  This spell grants the caster a powerful sixth sense in relation to himself or another.Although cast upon himself, the wizard can specify that he or another is the beneficiary of the spell. Once the spell is cast, the wizard receives instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the object of the spell. Thus, if he were the object of the
spell, the wizard would be warned in advance if a thief were about to attempt to backstab him, or if a creature were about to leap out from an unexpected direction, or if an attacker were specifically targeting him with a spell or missile weapon. When the warnings are about him personally, the wizard cannot be surprised and always knows the direction from which any attack on him is made. In addition, the spell gives the wizard a general idea of what action he might take to best protect himself--duck, jump right, close his eyes, etc.--and gives him a defensive bonus of 2 to his Armor Class.

				<div class="description-content">  This spell grants the caster a powerful sixth sense in relation to himself or another.Although cast upon himself, the wizard can specify that he or another is the beneficiary of the spell. Once the spell is cast, the wizard receives instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the object of the spell. Thus, if he were the object of the<br />spell, the wizard would be warned in advance if a thief were about to attempt to backstab him, or if a creature were about to leap out from an unexpected direction, or if an attacker were specifically targeting him with a spell or missile weapon. When the warnings are about him personally, the wizard cannot be surprised and always knows the direction from which any attack on him is made. In addition, the spell gives the wizard a general idea of what action he might take to best protect himself--duck, jump right, close his eyes, etc.--and gives him a defensive bonus of 2 to his Armor Class.<br />   When another person is the object of the spell, the wizard receives warnings about that person. He must still communicate this to the other person to negate any surprise. Shouting a warning, yanking the person back, and even telepathically communicating through a crystal ball can all be accomplished before the trap is sprung, if the wizard does not hesitate. However, the object of the spell does not gain the defensive bonus to his Armor Class.<br />  The material component for this spell is a hummingbird&#039;s feather.</div>

"description":"  This spell enables the wizard to conjure up an immobile, opaque globe of shimmering, multicolored light to surround him, giving protection from all forms of attack. The sphere flashes in all colors of the visible spectrum, seven of which have distinct powers and purposes. Any creature with fewer than 8 Hit Dice is blinded for 2d4 turns by the colors
of the sphere. Only the spellcaster can pass in and out of the prismatic sphere without harm, though he can cast it over others to protect them. The sphere can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order, by various magical effects; however, the first must be brought down before the second can be affected, and so on. Any creature passing
through the barrier receives the effect of every color still remaining. The following table shows the colors and effects of the prismatic sphere, as well as what will negate each globe.
  Note that typically the upper hemisphere of the globe is visible, as the spellcaster is at the center of the sphere, so the lower half is usually hidden by the floor surface he is standing on.
  Furthermore, a rod of cancellation or a Mordenkainen's disjunction spell will destroy a prismatic sphere (but an antimagic shell will fail to penetrate it). Otherwise, anything short of an artifact or relic entering the sphere is destroyed, and any creature is subject to the effects of every color still active--i.e., 70-140 points of damage plus death, petrification, insanity, and instantaneous transportation to another plane."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">  This spell enables the wizard to conjure up an immobile, opaque globe of shimmering, multicolored light to surround him, giving protection from all forms of attack. The sphere flashes in all colors of the visible spectrum, seven of which have distinct powers and purposes. Any creature with fewer than 8 Hit Dice is blinded for 2d4 turns by the colors<br />of the sphere. Only the spellcaster can pass in and out of the prismatic sphere without harm, though he can cast it over others to protect them. The sphere can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order, by various magical effects; however, the first must be brought down before the second can be affected, and so on. Any creature passing<br />through the barrier receives the effect of every color still remaining. The following table shows the colors and effects of the prismatic sphere, as well as what will negate each globe.<br />  Note that typically the upper hemisphere of the globe is visible, as the spellcaster is at the center of the sphere, so the lower half is usually hidden by the floor surface he is standing on.<br />  Furthermore, a rod of cancellation or a Mordenkainen&#039;s disjunction spell will destroy a prismatic sphere (but an antimagic shell will fail to penetrate it). Otherwise, anything short of an artifact or relic entering the sphere is destroyed, and any creature is subject to the effects of every color still active--i.e., 70-140 points of damage plus death, petrification, insanity, and instantaneous transportation to another plane.</div>

For example, a wizard is in combat and assumes the form of a will o' wisp. When this form is no longer useful, the wizard changes into a stone golem and walks away.

A wizard adopting another form also adopts its vulnerabilities.

Unlike similar spells, a wizard who is killed in another form does not revert to his original shape, which may disallow certain types of revivification.

No other spell or magical item has any effect on a sphere of ultimate destruction.

"description":" This spell confronts those affected by it with phantasmal images of their most feared enemies, forcing an imaginary combat that seems real, but actually occurs in the blink of an eye. When this spell is cast, the wizard must be able to converse with the victims to bring the spell into being. During the casting, the wizard must call out to the creatures to be affected, informing one or all that their final fate, indeed their doom, is now upon them.
 The force of the magic is such that even if the creatures make their saving throws vs. spell, fear will paralyze them for a full round, and they will lose 1d4 Strength points from this fear (the lost Strength will return in one turn). Failure to save vs. spell causes the creature or creatures to face their nemeses, the opponents most feared and inimical to them. Actual combat must then take place, for no magical means of escape is possible. The foe fought is real for all intents and purposes; affected creatures that lose will die. If a creature's phantasmal nemesis from the weird spell is slain, the creature emerges with no damage, no loss of items seemingly used in the combat, and no loss of spells likewise seemingly expended. The creature also gains any experience for defeating the weird, if applicable.
 Although each round of combat seems normal, it takes only one-tenth of a round. During the course of the spell, the caster must concentrate fully upon maintaining it. If the combat goes beyond 10 rounds, those who saved against the spell can take action. If the caster is disturbed, the weird spell ends immediately. Creatures attacked while paralyzed with fear are free of the paralysis immediately."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content"> This spell confronts those affected by it with phantasmal images of their most feared enemies, forcing an imaginary combat that seems real, but actually occurs in the blink of an eye. When this spell is cast, the wizard must be able to converse with the victims to bring the spell into being. During the casting, the wizard must call out to the creatures to be affected, informing one or all that their final fate, indeed their doom, is now upon them.<br /> The force of the magic is such that even if the creatures make their saving throws vs. spell, fear will paralyze them for a full round, and they will lose 1d4 Strength points from this fear (the lost Strength will return in one turn). Failure to save vs. spell causes the creature or creatures to face their nemeses, the opponents most feared and inimical to them. Actual combat must then take place, for no magical means of escape is possible. The foe fought is real for all intents and purposes; affected creatures that lose will die. If a creature&#039;s phantasmal nemesis from the weird spell is slain, the creature emerges with no damage, no loss of items seemingly used in the combat, and no loss of spells likewise seemingly expended. The creature also gains any experience for defeating the weird, if applicable.<br /> Although each round of combat seems normal, it takes only one-tenth of a round.

"description":" The wish spell is a more potent version of a limited wish. If it is used to alter reality with respect to damage sustained by a party, to bring a dead creature to life, or to escape from a difficult situation by lifting the spellcaster (and his party) from one place to another, it will not cause the wizard any disability. Other forms of wishes, however, cause the spellcaster to weaken (-3 on Strength) and require 2d4 days of bed rest due to the stresses the wish places upon time, space, and his body. Regardless of what is wished for, the exact terminology of the wish spell is likely to be carried out. Casting a wish spell ages the caster five years.
 Discretionary power of the DM is necessary in order to maintain game balance. For example, wishing another creature dead is grossly unfair; the DM might well advance the spellcaster to a future period in which the creature is no longer alive, effectively putting the wishing character out of the campaign."}</textarea>
