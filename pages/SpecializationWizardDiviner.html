The volume of sound created, however, is directly related to the level of the spellcaster. 

The volume is based upon the lowest level at which the spell can be cast, 1st level. The noise of the audible glamer at this level is that of four men, maximum. Each additional experience level of the wizard adds a like volume, so that at 2nd level the wizard can have the spell cause sound equal to that of eight men. Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The auditory illusion created by an audible glamer spell can be virtually any type of sound, but the relative volume must be commensurate with the level of the wizard casting the spell. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight men running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise volume of 16 men, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise volume of no fewer than 24 men.

A character stating that he does not believe the sound receives a saving throw, and if it succeeds, the character then hears a faint and obviously false sound, emanating from the caster's direction. 

Note that this spell can enhance the effectiveness of the phantasmal force spell.

"description":"Cantrips are minor spells I studied by wizards during their apprenticeship, regardless of school. The cantrip spell is a practice method for the apprentice, teaching him how to tap minute amounts of magical energy. Once cast, the cantrip spell enables the caster to create minor magical effects for the duration of the spell. 

So minor are these effects that they have severe limitations. They are completely unable to cause a loss of hit points, cannot affect the concentration of spellcasters, and can only create small, obviously magical materials. Furthermore, materials created by a cantrip are extremely fragile and cannot be used as tools of any sort. Lastly, a cantrip lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. 
Whatever manifestation the cantrip takes, it remains in effect only as long as the wizard concentrates. Wizards typically use cantrips to impress common folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives. 

Common tricks with cantrips include tinklings of ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, glowing balls that float over the caster's hand, puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of bland food, and little whirlwinds to sweep dust under rugs. Combined with the unseen servant spell, these are the tools to make housekeeping and entertaining simpler for the wizard."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not.
The person receives a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect, with any adjustment due to Wisdom (see Table 5). If the person receives damage from the caster group in the same round the charm is cast an additional bonus of +1 per hit point of damage received is added to the victim's saving throw.
If the spell recipient fails his saving throw, he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton, but any word or action of the caster is viewed in the most favorable way. 
Thus, a charmed person would not obey suicide command, but he might believe the caster if assured that the only chance to save the caster's life is for the person to hold back an on rushing red dragon for \"just a round or two.\" Note also that the spell does not endow the caster with linguistic capabilities beyond those he normally possesses (i.e., he must speak the victim's language to communicate his commands).
The duration of the spell is a function of the charmed person's Intelligence and is tied to the saving throw. The spell may be broken if a successful saving throw is rolled, and this saving throw is checked on a periodic basis, according to the creature's Intelligence (see the following table). If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed person by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed person, the charm spell is broken.
If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the result is decided by the DM. This could range from one effect being clearly dominant, to the subject being torn by conflicting desires, to new saving throws that could negate both spells.
Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he was charmed.

Time Between Checks for Intelligence Score of 3 or less: 3 months
Time Between Checks for Intelligence Score of 4 to 6: 2 months
Time Between Checks for Intelligence Score of 7 to 9: 1 month
Time Between Checks for Intelligence Score of 10 to 12: 3 weeks

Time Between Checks for Intelligence Score of 19 or more: 1 days

Note: The period between checks is the time period during which the check occurs. When to roll the check during this time is determined (randomly or by selection) by the DM. The roll is made secretly."}</textarea>

Scanning a direction requires one round, and the caster must be motionless.<br /><br />While the spell indicates direction, it does not give specific location or distance. It detects undead through walls and obstacles but is blocked by 1 foot of solid stone, 1 yard of wood or loose earth, or a thin coating of metal. The spell does not indicate the type of undead detected, only that undead are present.<br /><br />The material component for this spell is a bit of earth from a grave.<br /></div>

"description":"This spell causes instant growth of a creature or object, increasing both size and weight. It can be cast only upon a single creature (or a symbiotic or community entity) or upon a single object that does not exceed ten cubic feet in volume per caster level. The object or creature must be seen to be affected.
 
It grows by up to 10% per level of experience of the wizard, increasing this amount in height, width, and weight. Magical properties are not increased by this spell - a huge sword +1 is still only +1, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions, a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate, etc. Weight, mass and strength are affected, though. Thus, a table blocking a door would be heavier and more effective, a hurled stein would have more mass (and cause more damage), chains would be more massive, doors thicker, a thin line turned to a sizeable, longer rope, and so on. A creature's hit points, Armor Class, and attack rolls do not change, but damage rolls increase proportionally with size. 

For example, a fighter at 160% normal size hits with his long sword and rolls a 6 for damage. The adjusted damage roll is 10 (that is 6 x 1.6 = 9.6, rounded up). Bonuses due to Strength, class, and magic are not altered.

The reverse spell, reduce, negates the enlarge spell or makes creatures or objects smaller. The creature or object loses 10% of its original size for every level of the caster, to a minimum of 10% of the original size. Thereafter, the size shrinks by one-foot increments to less than one foot, by one-inch increments to one inch, and by 1/10-inch increments to a minimum of 1/10 of an inch - the recipient cannot dwindle away to nothingness.

For example, a 16-foot-tall giant reduced by a 15th-level wizard (15 steps) would be reduced to 1.6 feet (in nine steps), then to 6/10 of a foot or 7.2 inches (in one step), and finally to 2.2 inches (in the last five steps). A shrinking object may damage weaker materials affixed to it, but an object will shrink only as long as the object itself is not damaged. Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell.

"description":"When an identify spell is cast, magical items subsequently touched by the wizard can be identified. The eight hours immediately preceeding the casting of the spell must be spent purifying the items and removing influences that would corrupt and blur their magical auras. If this period is interrupted, it must be begun again. When the spell is cast, each item must be handled in turn by the wizard. Any consequences of this handling fall fully upon the wizard and may end the spell, although the wizard is allowed any applicable saving throw.

The chance of learning a piece of information about an item is equal to 10% per level of the caster, to a maximum of 90%, rolled by the DM. Any roll of 96-00 indicates a false reading (91-95 reveal nothing). Only one function of a multi-function item is discovered per handling (i.e., a 5-th level wizard could attempt to determine the nature of five different items, five different functions of a single item, or any combination of the two). If any attempt at reading fails, the caster cannot learn any more about that item until he advances a level. Note that some items, such as special magical tomes, cannot be identified with this spell.

The item never reveals its exact attack or damage bonuses, although the fact that it has few or many bonuses can be determined. If it has charges, only a general indication of the number of charges remaining is learned: powerful (81% - 100% of the total possible charges), strong (61% - 80%), moderate (41% - 60%), weak (6% - 40%), or faint (five charges or less). The faint result takes precedence, so a fully charges ring of three wishes always appears to be only faintly charged.

After casting the spell and determining what can be learned from it, the wizard loses 8 points of Constitution. He must rest for one hour to recover each point of Constitution. If the 8-point loss drops the spellcaster below a Constitution of 1, he falls unconscious. Consciousness is not regained until full Constitution is restored, which takes 24 hours (one point per three hours for an unconscious character).

The material components of this spell are a pearl (of at least 100gp value) and an owl feather steeped in wine, with the infusion drunk prior to spellcasting. If a luckstone is powdered and added to the infusion, the divination becomes much more potent: exact bonuses or charges can be determined, and the functions of a multi-functional item can be learned from a single reading.

At the DM's option, certain properties of an artifact or relic might also be learned."}</textarea>

"description":"A spook spell enables the wizard to play upon natural fears to cause the target creature to perceive the spellcaster as someone or something inimical. Without actually knowing what this is, the wizard merely advances threateningly upon the creature. If a successful saving throw vs. spell is not made, the creature turns and flees at maximum speed as far from the wizard as possible, though items carried are not dropped. The creature has a saving throw penalty of -1 for every two experience levels of the caster, to a maximum of -6 at 12th level. 

Note that a natural (unmodified) roll of 20 automatically succeeds, regardless of saving throw penalties. Although the caster does not actually pursue the fleeing creature, a phantasm from its own mind does. Each round after the initial casting, the creature receives another saving throw, without penalty, until it successfully saves and the spell is broken. 

In any event, the spell functions only against creatures with Intelligences of 2 or more, and undead are not affected at all.

				<div class="description-content">A spook spell enables the wizard to play upon natural fears to cause the target creature to perceive the spellcaster as someone or something inimical. Without actually knowing what this is, the wizard merely advances threateningly upon the creature. If a successful saving throw vs. spell is not made, the creature turns and flees at maximum speed as far from the wizard as possible, though items carried are not dropped. The creature has a saving throw penalty of -1 for every two experience levels of the caster, to a maximum of -6 at 12th level. <br /><br />Note that a natural (unmodified) roll of 20 automatically succeeds, regardless of saving throw penalties. Although the caster does not actually pursue the fleeing creature, a phantasm from its own mind does. Each round after the initial casting, the creature receives another saving throw, without penalty, until it successfully saves and the spell is broken. <br /><br />In any event, the spell functions only against creatures with Intelligences of 2 or more, and undead are not affected at all.<br /></div>

"description":"The invoker loudly calls the magic words to this spell and points at a target within range, bringing forth a spray of 20 miniature golden magic missiles. If the target of the attack fails their saving throw (dex suggested), they take an amount of damage equal to the difference between their failed save and what they needed to succeed, indicating the number of miniature magic missiles that struck the target. Furthermore, characters in magical or metal armor suffer a damage reduction of half. Characters wielding a shield may add 2 to their save.

Example: Diana the Invoker casts Arcane Spray at a hobgoblin warlord. Diana rolls a d20+21 (15 Int, level 3) and rolls a natural 20, for a combined roll of 41. The hobgoblin warlord rolls a d20+18 (12 Dex, level 3) and rolls a natural 2, for a combined roll of 20. The difference between the two is 21, so the hobgoblin warlord takes maximum damage of 20. Were the warlord to be wearing chain mail, the damage would be reduced to 10.

Spell effects that penalize missile fire, but not natural effects, grant a penalty to the caster's save equal to the missile fire penalty. "}</textarea>

"description":"A flaming sphere spell creates a burning globe of fire within ten yards of the caster. This sphere rolls in whichever direction the wizard points, at a rate of 30 feet per round. It rolls over barriers less than four feet tall, such as furniture, low walls, etc. 
Flammable substances are set afire by contact with the sphere. Creatures in contact with the globe must successfully save vs. spell or suffer 2d4 points of fire damage. Those within five feet of the sphere's surface must also save or suffer 1d4 points of heat damage. A successful saving throw means no damage is suffered. 

The DM may adjust the saving throws if there is little or no room to dodge the sphere.

The sphere moves as long as the spellcaster actively directs it, otherwise it merely stays at rest and burns. It can be extinguished by the same means as any normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push unwilling creatures aside or batter down large obstacles.

This sphere rolls in whichever direction the wizard points, at a rate of 30 feet per round. It rolls over barriers less than four feet tall, such as furniture, low walls, etc. <br />Flammable substances are set afire by contact with the sphere. Creatures in contact with the globe must successfully save vs. spell or suffer 2d4 points of fire damage. Those within five feet of the sphere&#039;s surface must also save or suffer 1d4 points of heat damage. A successful saving throw means no damage is suffered. <br /><br />The DM may adjust the saving throws if there is little or no room to dodge the sphere.<br /><br />The sphere moves as long as the spellcaster actively directs it, otherwise it merely stays at rest and burns. It can be extinguished by the same means as any normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push unwilling creatures aside or batter down large obstacles.<br /><br />The material components are a bit of tallow, a pinch of sulphur, and a dusting of powdered iron.</div>

"description":"The fog cloud spell can be cast in one of two ways, at the caster's option: as a large, stationary bank of normal fog, or as a harmless fog that resembles the 5th-level wizard spell cloudkill.

As a fog bank, this spell creates a fog of any size and shape up to a maximum 20-foot cube per caster level. The fog obscures all sight, normal and infravision, beyond two feet.

As a cloudkill-like fog, this is a billowing mass of ghastly, yellowish-green vapors, measuring 40 feet x 20 feet x 20 feet. This moves away from the caster at 10 feet per round. The vapors are heavier than air and sink to the lowest level, even pouring down sinkholes and den openings. Very thick vegetation breaks up the fog after it has moved 20 feet into the vegetation.

The only effect of either version is to obscure vision. 

A strong breeze will disperse either effect in one round, while a moderate breeze will reduce the spell duration by 50%. 

The spell cannot be cast under water."}</textarea>

"description":"An irritation spell affects the epidermis of the subject creatures. Creatures with very thick or insensitive skins (such as buffalo, elephants, scaled creatures, etc.) are basically unaffected. There are two versions of the spell, either of which can be cast from the standard preparation:

Itching. When cast, this causes each subject to feel an instant itching sensation on some portion of its body. If one round is not immediately spent scratching the irritated area, the creature is so affected that the next three rounds are spent squirming and twisting, effectively worsening its Armor Class by 4 and its attack rolls by 2 during this time. Spell preparations are ruined in the first round this spell is in effect, but not in the following three rounds. Doing nothing but scratching the itch for a full round prevents the rest of the effect. If cast at one creature, the saving throw has a -3 penalty; if cast at two creatures, the saving throw has a -1 penalty; and if cast at three or four creatures, the saving throw is normal.

Rash. When a rash is cast, the subject notices nothing for 1d4 rounds, but thereafter its entire skin breaks out in red welts that itch. The rash persists until either a cure disease or dispel magic spell is cast upon it. It lowers Charisma by 1 point per day for each of four days (i.e., maximum Charisma loss is 4 points). After one week, Dexterity is lowered by 1 point also. Symptoms vanish immediately upon the removal of the rash, and all statistics return to normal. This can be cast at one creature only, with a saving throw penalty of -2.

The material component for this spell is a leaf from poison ivy, oak, or sumac."}</textarea>

Each spell can undo up to two means of preventing egress through a portal. Thus if a door is locked, barred, and held, or triple locked, opening it requires two knock spells.

Example: Bobo the diviner casts Locate Landmark, with the landmark in question being the secret burial ground of elves. Bobo is in a human dominated region, where nobody knows the answer to this question, so it returns no answer.

				<div class="description-content">This spell aids in locating a known or familiar object. The wizard casts the spell, slowly turns, and senses when he is facing in the direction of the object to be located, provided the object is within range, i.e., 60 yards for 3rd-level wizards, 80 yards for 4th, 100 yards for 5th, etc. <br /><br />The spell can locate such objects as apparel, jewelry, furniture, tools, weapons, or even a ladder or stairway. Note that attempting to find a specific item, such as jewelry or a crown, requires an accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the actual, the spell does not work. Desired but unique objects cannot be located by this spell unless they are known by the caster. The spell is blocked by lead.<br /><br />Creatures cannot be found by this spell.<br /><br />The material component is a forked twig.<br /><br />The reversal, obscure object, hides an object from location by spell, crystal ball, or similar means for eight hours. Creatures cannot be affected by this spell. The material component is a chameleon skin.</div>

"description":"When this spell is cast, the wizard imbues the chosen object with an enchanted mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message when a specified event occurs. The message, which must be of 25 words or less, can be in any language known by the spellcaster, and can be delivered over a period of one turn. 

The mouth cannot speak magical spells or use command words. It does, however, move to the words articulated - if it is placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would actually move and appear to speak. Of course, the magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, door, or any other object, excluding intelligent members of the animal or vegetable kingdoms. 

The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled, according to the command of the spellcaster. 

Some examples are to speak \"to the first creature that touches you,\" or \"to the first creature that passes within 30 feet.\" Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used, such as the following: \"Speak only when a venerable female human carrying a sack of groat clusters sits crosslegged within 1 foot.\" Such visual triggers can react to a character using the disguise ability. Command range is 5 yards per level of the wizard, so a 6th-level wizard can command the magic mouth to speak at a maximum encounter range of 30 yards (\"Speak when a winged creature comes within 30 yards.\"). 

The spell lasts until the speak command can be fulfilled; thus, the spell duration is variable. A magic mouth cannot distinguish invisible creatures, alignments, level, Hit Dice, or class, except by external garb. If desired, the effect can be keyed to a specific noise or spoken word.

Unlike a magic mouth spell, a moon rune is permanent and will appear any time its conditions are met.<br /><br />In addition to appearing when the proper conditions are met, a moon rune also becomes visible if a detect magic, detect invisibility, true seeing, or other such spell or effect is used on it. A read magic spell will reveal the maker&#039;s words, if any. Moon rune cannot be cast on a living creature. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an erase spell.<br /><br />A moon rune requires a special mixture of pigment including mithril filings or powder worth at least 100gp.</div>

First, it can produce a flashing and fiery burst of glowing, colored aerial fireworks that lasts one round. This effect temporarily blinds those creatures in, under, or within 120 feet of the area and that have an unobstructed line of sight to the burst. Creatures viewing this are blinded for 1d4+1 rounds unless they successfully save vs. spell. The fireworks fill a volume 10 times greater than that of the original fire source.

This spell can also cause a thick, writhing stream of smoke to arise from the source and form a choking cloud that lasts for one round per experience level of the caster. This covers a roughly spherical volume from the ground or floor up (or conforming to the shape of a confined area) that totally obscures vision beyond 2 feet. The smoke fills a volume 100 times that of the fire source. All within the cloud must roll successful saving throws vs. spell or suffer -2 penalties to all combat rolls and Armor Class.

The spell uses one fire source within a 20-foot cube, which is immediately extinguished. An extremely large fire used as a source might be only partially extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based creature (such as a fire elemental) used as a source suffers 1 point of damage per caster level."}</textarea>

Creatures viewing this are blinded for 1d4+1 rounds unless they successfully save vs. spell. The fireworks fill a volume 10 times greater than that of the original fire source.<br /><br />This spell can also cause a thick, writhing stream of smoke to arise from the source and form a choking cloud that lasts for one round per experience level of the caster. This covers a roughly spherical volume from the ground or floor up (or conforming to the shape of a confined area) that totally obscures vision beyond 2 feet. The smoke fills a volume 100 times that of the fire source. All within the cloud must roll successful saving throws vs. spell or suffer -2 penalties to all combat rolls and Armor Class.<br /><br />The spell uses one fire source within a 20-foot cube, which is immediately extinguished. An extremely large fire used as a source might be only partially extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based creature (such as a fire elemental) used as a source suffers 1 point of damage per caster level.</div>

"description":"A web spell creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points - floor and ceiling, opposite walls, etc., or the web collapses upon itself and disappears.

The web spell covers a maximum area of eight 10' x 10' x 10' cubes and the webs must be at least 10 feet thick, so a mass 40 feet high, 20 feet wide, and 10 feet deep may be cast. Creatures caught within webs, or simply touching them, become stuck among the gluey fibers. 

Anyone in the area when the spell is cast must roll a saving throw vs. spell with a -2 penalty. If the saving throw is successful, two things may have occurred. If the creature has room to escape the area, then it is assumed to have jumped free. If there is no room to escape, then the webs are only half strength. Creatures with less than 13 Strength (7 if the webs are half strength) are stuck until freed by another or until the spell wears off. Missile fire is generally ineffective against creatures trapped in webs.

Creatures with Strengths between 13 and 17 can break through 1 foot of webs per round. Creatures with 18 or greater Strength can break through 2 feet of webs per round. If the webs are at half strength, these rates are doubled. (Great mass equates to great strength in this case, and creatures of large mass hardly notice webs.) Strong and huge creatures can break through 10 feet of webs per round.

Furthermore, the strands of a web spell are flammable. A magical flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire - torch, flaming oil, flaming sword, etc. - can set them alight and burn them away in a single round. All creatures within flaming webs suffer 2d4 points of damage from the flames, but those free of the strands are not harmed.

The material component of this spell is a bit of spider web."}</textarea>

These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points - floor and ceiling, opposite walls, etc., or the web collapses upon itself and disappears.<br /><br />The web spell covers a maximum area of eight 10&#039; x 10&#039; x 10&#039; cubes and the webs must be at least 10 feet thick, so a mass 40 feet high, 20 feet wide, and 10 feet deep may be cast. Creatures caught within webs, or simply touching them, become stuck among the gluey fibers. <br /><br />Anyone in the area when the spell is cast must roll a saving throw vs. spell with a -2 penalty. If the saving throw is successful, two things may have occurred. If the creature has room to escape the area, then it is assumed to have jumped free. If there is no room to escape, then the webs are only half strength. Creatures with less than 13 Strength (7 if the webs are half strength) are stuck until freed by another or until the spell wears off. Missile fire is generally ineffective against creatures trapped in webs.<br /><br />Creatures with Strengths between 13 and 17 can break through 1 foot of webs per round. Creatures with 18 or greater Strength can break through 2 feet of webs per round. If the webs are at half strength, these rates are doubled. (Great mass equates to great strength in this case, and creatures of large mass hardly notice webs.) Strong and huge creatures can break through 10 feet of webs per round.<br /><br />Furthermore, the strands of a web spell are flammable. A magical flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire - torch, flaming oil, flaming sword, etc. - can set them alight and burn them away in a single round. All creatures within flaming webs suffer 2d4 points of damage from the flames, but those free of the strands are not harmed.<br /><br />The material component of this spell is a bit of spider web.</div>

(Direction is determined by roll of ld8: 1 = right ahead, 2 = right, 3 = right behind, 4 = behind, 5 = left behind, 6 = left, 7 left ahead, 8 = ahead.) 

The caster cannot blink into a solid object; if such is indicated, reroll the direction. Movable objects of size and mass comparable to the caster are shoved aside when the caster blinks in. If blinking is impossible except into a fixed, solid object, the caster is then trapped on the Ethereal plane.

During each round that he blinks, the spellcaster can be attacked only by opponents who win initiative or by those who are able to strike both locations at once (e.g., with a breath weapon, fireball, or similar wide-area attack forms). Opponents with multiple attacks, or those operating under haste or similar effects, can often strike early enough to have at least one attack against the caster.

If the spellcaster holds off his attack (if any) until after the blink, the 2d8 delay until the blink is added to his normal ldl0 initiative roll (thus he probably attacks last in the round). Or the spellcaster can try to get his attack in before he blinks (he must announce his intent before rolling the 2d8 for blink timing and the 1d10 for initiative). In this case, the caster compares the two dice rolls, hoping that his initiative roll is lower than his blink roll (the two rolls are not added if he is trying to attack before he blinks). If so, he attacks according to his initiative roll, then blinks according to the blink roll. 

If his blink roll is lower than his initiative roll, however, he blinks out, then he attacks in whatever direction he's facing (he must go through with his attack, even if he is facing in the wrong direction to affect anyone).

"description":"When a wizard casts this spell, it has a chance to neutralize or negate magic it comes in contact with, as follows:

First, it removes spells and spell-like effects (including device effects and innate abilities) from creatures or objects.

Second, it disrupts the casting or use of these in the area of effect at the instant the dispel is cast. 

Third, it destroys magical potions (which are treated as 12th level for purposes of this spell). 

Each effect or potion in the spell's area is checked to determine if it is dispelled. The caster can always dispel his own magic; otherwise the chance to dispel depends on the difference in level between the magical effect and the caster. The base chance is 50% (11 or higher on 1d20 to dispel).

If the caster is higher level than the creator of the effect to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted from the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (thus making it more likely that the dispel succeeds); if the caster is of lower level, then the difference is added to the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (making it less likely that the dispel succeeds). A roll of 20 always succeeds and a roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher, only a roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dispelled.

A dispel magic spell does not affect a specially enchanted item, such as a magical scroll, ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous item, weapon, shield, or armor, unless it is cast directly upon the item. This renders the item nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An item possessed and carried by a creature gains the creature's saving throw against this effect, otherwise it is automatically rendered nonoperational. 

An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) rendered nonoperational would be temporarily closed. Note that an item's physical properties are unchanged: a nonoperational magical sword is still a sword.

Artifacts and relics are not subject to this spell; however, some of their spell-like effects may be, at the DMs option.
Note that this spell can be very effective when used upon charmed and similarly beguiled creatures. Certain spells or effects cannot be dispelled; these are listed in the spell descriptions."}</textarea>

The burst of the fireball creates little pressure and generally conforms to the shape of the area in which it occurs. The fireball fills an area equal to its normal spherical volume (roughly 33,000 cubic feet - thirty-three 10' x 10' x 10' cubes).

Besides causing damage to creatures, the fireball ignites all combustible materials within its burst radius, and the
heat of the fireball melts soft metals such as gold, copper, silver, etc. Exposed items require saving throws vs. magical fire to determine if they are affected, but items in the possession of a creature that rolls a successful saving throw are unaffected by the fireball.

The wizard points his finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results in an early detonation). Creatures failing their saving throws each suffer full damage from the blast. 

Those who roll successful saving throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half damage (the DM rolls the damage and each affected creature suffers either full damage or half damage [round fractions down], depending on whether the creature saved or not).

"description":"This spell holds 1d4 humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile for five or more rounds.

The hold person spell affects any bipedal human, demihuman or humanoid of man-size or smaller, including brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others.

The spell is centered on a point selected by the caster; it affects persons selected by the caster within the area of effect.

If the spell is cast at three or four people, each gets an unmodified saving throw. If only two people are being enspelled, each makes his saving throw with a -1 penalty. If the spell is cast at only one person, the saving throw suffers a -3 penalty. Saving throws are adjusted for Wisdom. Those succeeding on their saving throws are unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.

Held beings cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison. The caster can end the spell with a single utterance at any time; otherwise the duration is 10 rounds at 5th level, 12 rounds at 6th level, 14 rounds at 7th level, etc.

The spellcaster needs a small, straight piece of iron as the material component of this spell.

"description":"By positioning a creature against a mirror, and marking their forehead with their own blood, the necromancer entombs the creature inside a mirror. The mirror must be of a size to hold the creature. Spells that change the size of the creature prevent the creature from being entombed until the spell is worn off. Similarly, mirrors that are magically changed in size are unsuitable for this task.

Once a creature is held in a mirror, it is in a state of two dimensional semi-stasis. The creature does not heal, does not age, has no need of food, drink, or bodily functions, yet they may still move and speak (if they were able to outside of the mirror). Furthermore, those trapped in the mirror find that their three dimensional belongings no longer function in two dimensional space: books cannot be read, potions cannot be consumed, itches cannot be scratched, etc. Creatures with magical abilities (spells, gazes, etc.) will find that their spells are restricted to the mirror dimension in which they are placed. A basilisk would not petrify someone looking at it, nor could a mage within a mirror cast Magic Missile at someone on the other side or at the mirror itself.

Creatures inside the mirror are aware of what is happening on the outside of the mirror, being able to see, hear, and smell. Similarly, creatures on the outside of the mirror and see and hear those trapped within. Those inside the mirror may walk around within the confines of the mirror, and may come into the foreground (between the onlooker and their reflection) or stay in the background (behind the reflection of creatures). 

If the mirror is broken or damaged (scratching the glass counts as damaged), the magic is broken, the mirror shatters, and the creature is freed, in the exact state it was originally imprisoned.

A shatter spell cast from within the mirror dimension will break the mirror. Spells that move between dimensions can be used as long as they do not require 3 dimensional space (A spell that opens a portal one walks through would not work, but a spell that shifts the caster from one dimension to another will). Teleportation has no effect.

A caster may not imprison themselves in a mirror."}</textarea>

"description":"Upon casting this spell, the wizard releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy that inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level of the spellcaster (maximum damage of 10d6) to each creature within its area of effect. A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces this damage to half (round fractions down).

The bolt begins at a range and height decided by the caster and streaks outward in a direct line from the casting wizard (e.g., if a 40-foot bolt was started at 180 feet from the wizard, the far end of bolt would reach 220 feet (180 + 40). 

The lightning bolt may set fire to combustibles, sunder wooden doors, splinter up to 1/2 foot thickness of stone, and melt metals with a low melting point (lead, gold, copper, silver, bronze). 

Saving throws must be rolled for objects that withstand the full force of a stroke (see the fireball spell). If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it (i.e., the saving throw fails), the bolt continues. A bolt can breach one inch of wood or 1/2 inch of stone per caster level up to a maximum of one foot of wood or 1/2 foot of stone. 

The lightning bolt's area of effect is chosen by the spellcaster: either a forked bolt 10 feet wide and 40 feet long or a single bolt five feet wide and 80 feet long. If a bolt cannot reach its full length, because of an unyielding barrier (such as a stone wall), the lightning bolt rebounds from the barrier toward its caster, ending only when it reaches its full length.

Example: An 80-foot-long stroke is begun at a range of 40 feet, but it hits a stone wall at 50 feet. The bolt travels 10 feet, hits the wall, and rebounds for 70 feet back toward its creator (who is only 50 feet from the wall, and so is caught in his own lightning bolt!).

The DM might allow reflecting bolts. When this type of lightning bolt strikes a solid surface, the bolt reflects from the surface at an angle equal to the angle of incidence (like light off a mirror). A creature crossed more than once by the bolt must roll a saving throw for every time it is crossed, but it still suffers either full damage (if one saving throw is missed) or half damage (if all saving throws are made).

The material components of the spell are a bit of fur and an amber, crystal, or glass rod."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell is coupled with the second level Beacon spell to get the location of a specific beacon. The caster will need a beacon to lock onto, a high quality and accurate map of the region the beacon is suspected to be in, and a crystal lens worth 50gp that is consumed in the casting.

If the beacon was created by the caster, no unusual preparations are needed; but if the beacon was created by another caster, then she must first cast Locate Beacon on the beacon itself. Preparation similar to that of Identify must be undertaken, clearing and cleaning a space, having silence and stillness, and ridding the room of any other magical items. After the cleansing is done, the Locate Beacon spell can be cast on the enchanted object to understand its resonance, and prepare the caster to seek it out later. Once prepared in this way, the caster need never prepare or attune to the beacon again. An Identify spell cast on the enchanted object will also work to link to the beacon.

When a beacon is to be located, a map must be produced and the crystal lens placed on it. The Locate Beacon spell is cast on both the map and the lens (just the one casting) and the caster may then look through the lens at the map to find its location. If the map is detailed and accurate enough, and the beacon is somewhere depicted on the map, it will be seen as a pulsing green light about 1\" in diameter. The beacon is within the area of the light, but not exactly at its center. Two casters locating the same beacon on two different maps, one twice the size of the other and covering the same region, will have two different tolerances. A caster using a desk sized map of the world may only be able to pin the beacon down to a single kingdom. A map of that kingdom might reveal the beacon is in or near a specific city.

				<div class="description-content">This spell is coupled with the second level Beacon spell to get the location of a specific beacon. The caster will need a beacon to lock onto, a high quality and accurate map of the region the beacon is suspected to be in, and a crystal lens worth 50gp that is consumed in the casting.<br /><br />If the beacon was created by the caster, no unusual preparations are needed; but if the beacon was created by another caster, then she must first cast Locate Beacon on the beacon itself. Preparation similar to that of Identify must be undertaken, clearing and cleaning a space, having silence and stillness, and ridding the room of any other magical items. After the cleansing is done, the Locate Beacon spell can be cast on the enchanted object to understand its resonance, and prepare the caster to seek it out later. Once prepared in this way, the caster need never prepare or attune to the beacon again. An Identify spell cast on the enchanted object will also work to link to the beacon.<br /><br />When a beacon is to be located, a map must be produced and the crystal lens placed on it. The Locate Beacon spell is cast on both the map and the lens (just the one casting) and the caster may then look through the lens at the map to find its location. If the map is detailed and accurate enough, and the beacon is somewhere depicted on the map, it will be seen as a pulsing green light about 1&quot; in diameter. The beacon is within the area of the light, but not exactly at its center. Two casters locating the same beacon on two different maps, one twice the size of the other and covering the same region, will have two different tolerances. A caster using a desk sized map of the world may only be able to pin the beacon down to a single kingdom. A map of that kingdom might reveal the beacon is in or near a specific city. A map of that city might reveal the beacon is in a neighborhood or perhaps a specific building, depending on specific circumstances.<br /><br />The map must be well made, well informed, accurate, and precise. Maps of this quality are often at least 100gp in value. <br /><br />Beacon and Locate Beacon are often used by powerful merchants and nobles to track larges shipments of money. A single coin may be made a beacon, tossed in with the rest, and if the shipment doesn&#039;t get to where it was heading, can be tracked down hopefully before too much is spent or distributed.</div>

Example: a 40hp shell could block a 10 damage attack, a 5 damage attack, and then a 8 damage attack (leaving it at 17 hp).

The shell only blocks kinetic attacks (including falling), so breath weapons, fire, acid, etc. are not obstructed. Furthermore, the shell is activated when attacks come within the area of the shell, so it will trigger on missed attacks that roll at least a modified 10, or on attacks that must past through the shell's space, e.g. missile attacks at creatures behind one with magic shell.

The meteors are treated as missiles hurled by the wizard with a +2 bonus to the attack rolls and with no penalty for range. Misses are treated as grenade-like missiles that inflict 1 point of damage to creatures within three feet.

The spell can be cast in either of two ways:

A) The wizard discharges five meteors every round (see the \"Multiple Attacks and Initiative\" section in Chapter 9: Combat). Note that this carries over into at least the following round.

B) The wizard discharges only one meteor per round. In addition to releasing the missile, the caster can perform other actions in the round, including spellcasting, melee, or device use. Spells requiring concentration force the wizard to forgo the rest of the missiles to maintain concentration. 

Also, if the wizard fails to maintain an exact mental count of the number of missiles he has remaining, he has involuntarily lost the remaining portion of the spell.

The spell ends when the caster has fired off as many meteors as he has experience levels, when he forgoes casting any still remaining, or when a successful dispel magic spell is thrown upon the caster.

The components necessary for the casting of this spell are niter and sulphur formed into a bead by the addition of pine tar. The caster must also have a small hollow tube of minute proportion, fashioned from gold. The tube costs no less than 1,000 gp to construct, so fine is its workmanship and magical engraving, and it can be reused."}</textarea>

"description":"When this spell is cast by the wizard, he influences the actions of the chosen recipient by the utterance of a few words - phrases or a sentence or two - suggesting a course of action desirable to the spellcaster. The creature to be influenced must, of course, be able to understand the wizards suggestion - it must be spoken in a language that the spell recipient understands.

The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the action sound reasonable; asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell. 

However, a suggestion that a pool of acid was actually pure water and that a quick dip would be refreshing is another matter. Urging a red dragon to stop attacking the wizards party so that the dragon and party could jointly loot a rich treasure elsewhere is likewise a reasonable use of the spell's power.

The course of action of a suggestion can continue in effect for a considerable duration, such as in the case of the red dragon mentioned above. 

Conditions that will trigger a special action can also be specified; if the condition is not met before the spell expires, then the action will not be performed. 

If the target successfully rolls its saving throw, the spell has no effect.
 
Note that a very reasonable suggestion causes the saving throw to be made with a penalty (such as -1, -2, etc.) at the discretion of the Dungeon Master. 

Undead are not subject to suggestion.

The material components of this spell are a snake's tongue and either a bit of honey-comb or a drop of sweet oil."}</textarea>

The creature to be influenced must, of course, be able to understand the wizards suggestion - it must be spoken in a language that the spell recipient understands.<br /><br />The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the action sound reasonable; asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell. <br /><br />However, a suggestion that a pool of acid was actually pure water and that a quick dip would be refreshing is another matter. Urging a red dragon to stop attacking the wizards party so that the dragon and party could jointly loot a rich treasure elsewhere is likewise a reasonable use of the spell&#039;s power.<br /><br />The course of action of a suggestion can continue in effect for a considerable duration, such as in the case of the red dragon mentioned above. <br /><br />Conditions that will trigger a special action can also be specified; if the condition is not met before the spell expires, then the action will not be performed. <br /><br />If the target successfully rolls its saving throw, the spell has no effect.<br /> <br />Note that a very reasonable suggestion causes the saving throw to be made with a penalty (such as -1, -2, etc.) at the discretion of the Dungeon Master. <br /><br />Undead are not subject to suggestion.<br /><br />The material components of this spell are a snake&#039;s tongue and either a bit of honey-comb or a drop of sweet oil.</div>

"description":"This divination spell allows a number of creatures to understand and be understood by other recipients of this spell. Each creature that is to understand must have their ears touched by the caster, while each of the creatures that is to be understood must have their mouth (or origin of their speech) touched. All subjects of the spell need to be smeared with ink on their forehead (or equivalent) by the caster, and the caster must continue intoning the words to the spell as they move between recipients. During the casting of the spell, none of the recipients that have been marked may leave the AOE, else their ink fades and they are removed from the spell's effects. It is possible to have 2 people who can speak and 10 people who can listen.

When the spell ends, which happens when the duration expires, the caster cancels it, or the caster's light concentration is broken, the ink fades from each of the subjects of the spell.

Example: A diviner wishes to hold an audience with a goblin queen and his party. The goblin queen does not speak common, so the diviner touches the ears of the party members, himself, and the queen, while touching the lips of the queen and himself. All are marked with ink. When the spell takes effect, the goblin will only understand the caster, while the party will understand the goblin. This way the party (caster not included) can speak in common without the goblin understanding, but all can understand the goblin."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell calls into being a curtain or field of water that remains intact and upright in defiance of gravity. The wall lasts as long as the wizard chooses to concentrate on maintaining it or one round per level if the wizard chooses not to concentrate on holding it together. The caster may shape the wall of water in one of three ways:

A. Water Curtain. In this form, the wizard conjures one plane of water, 5 feet square and 1 foot thick, per experience level; for example, a 5th-level caster can create five 5-foot x 5-foot x 1-foot wall sections that would be enough to block an arched passageway 15 feet wide and 10 feet high with a curtain of water 1 foot thick. The curtain's lower edge must rest upon the ground, but need not be anchored on either side, and it remains cohesive and upright for the duration of the spell. Once raised, the wall cannot be moved.

B. Hemisphere. In this manifestation, the wall of water forms a dome 1 foot thick over the caster, with an inner radius equal to 3 feet plus 1 foot per caster level; a 7th level caster could create a dome with a 10 foot radius. The wall must rest upon the ground. The dome is immobile.

C. Sphere. If cast underwater, the caster may shape the wall of water into a sphere 1 foot thick, with an inner radius equal to 3 feet plus 1 foot per caster level (no air is in the sphere). The sphere is centered on the caster and moves with him.

In any form, the wall of water has two primary effects. First of all, missile fire through the wall is next to impossible, suffering a -4 attack penalty for each foot of thickness as well as -1 damage penalty for every two feet of thickness. Creatures gain a +1 bonus to saving throws against attack spells that must pass through the wall. If the spell allows no saving throw, none is granted by the wall of water. Secondly, physical passage through the wall is hindered; any creature trying to pass through must take one full round to do so and becomes soaked to the skin in the process. The wall of water can be defeated or bypassed by a number of spells or effects. At the end of the spell's duration, the water loses its cohesiveness and collapses, which may surprise those sheltering under the hemisphere or standing next to the curtain. Note the water itself may be fresh water (25% chance), salt water (50% chance) or brackish (25% chance), although the sphere will always be composed of the water type that surrounds it. The material component is a vial full of blessed spring water."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell causes confusion in one or more creatures within the area, creating indecision and the inability to take effective action. The spell affects 1d4 creatures, plus one creature per caster level. 
These creatures are allowed saving throws vs. spell with -2 penalties, adjusted for Wisdom. Those successfully saving are unaffected by the spell. Confused creatures react as follows (roll 1d10):

1 Wander away (unless prevented) for duration of spell
2-6 Stand confused one round (then roll again)
7-9 Attack nearest creature for one round (then roll again)
10 Act normally for one round (then roll again)

The spell lasts for two rounds plus one round for each level of the caster. Those who fail are checked by the DM for actions each round for the duration of the spell, or until the \"wander away for the duration of the spell\" result occurs.

Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible, according to their most typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). Saving throws and actions are checked at the beginning of each round. Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature.

If there are many creatures involved, the DM may decide to assume average results. For example, if there are 16 orcs affected and 25% could be expected to make the saving throw, then four are assumed to have succeeded. Out of the other 12, one wanders away, four attack the nearest creature, six stand confused, and the last acts normally but must check next round. Since the orcs are not near the party, the DM decides that two attacking the nearest creature attack each other, one attacks an orc that saved, and one attacks a confused orc, which strikes back. The next round, the base is 11 orcs, since four originally saved and one wandered off. Another one wanders off, five stand confused, four attack, and one acts normally.

If the wizard continues downward past 20 feet in earth, there is a 15% chance that the pit collapses. This check is made for every five feet dug beyond 20 feet. Sand tends to collapse after 10 feet, mud fills in and collapses after five feet, and quicksand fills in as rapidly as it is dug.

Any creature at the edge (within one foot) of a pit must roll a successful Dexterity check or fall into the hole. Creatures moving rapidly toward a pit dug immediately before them must roll a saving throw vs. spell to avoid falling in. Any creature in a pit being excavated can climb out at a rate decided by the DM. A creature caught in a collapsing pit must roll a saving throw vs. death to avoid being buried; it escapes the pit if successful. Tunneling is possible with this spell as long as there is space available for the material removed. 

Chances for collapse are doubled and the safe tunneling distance is half of the safe excavation depth, unless such construction is most carefully braced and supported.

The spell is also effective against creatures of earth and rock, particularly clay golems and those from the Elemental Plane of Earth. When cast upon such a creature, it suffers 4d6 points of damage. A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces this damage to half.
To activate the spell, the spellcaster needs a miniature shovel and tiny bucket and must continue to hold them while each pit is excavated. These items disappear at the conclusion of the spell."}</textarea>

"description":"When this spell is cast, the wizard can create a single emotional reaction in the subject creatures. The following are typical:

The recipients fight without shield and regardless of life, never checking morale. This spell counters (and is countered by) fear.

2. Fear: The affected creatures flee in panic for 2d4 rounds. It counters (and is countered by) courage.

3. Friendship: The affected creatures react more positively (for example, tolerance becomes goodwill). It counters (and is countered by) hate.

4. Happiness: This effect creates joy and a feeling of complacent well-being, adding +4 to all reaction rolls and making attack unlikely unless the creatures are subject to extreme provocation. It counters (and is countered by) sadness.

6. Hope: The effect of hope is to raise morale, saving throw rolls, attack rolls, and damage caused by +2. It counters (and is countered by) hopelessness.

7. Hopelessness: The affected creatures submit to the demands of any opponent: surrender, get out, etc. Otherwise, the creatures are 25% likely to do nothing in a round, and 25% likely to turn back or retreat. It counters (and is countered by) hope.

8. Sadness: This creates unhappiness and a tendency toward maudlin introspection. This emotion penalizes surprise rolls by -1 and adds +1 to initiative rolls. It counters (and is countered by) happiness.

All creatures in the area at the instant the spell is cast are affected unless successful saving throws vs. spell are made, adjusted for Wisdom.

Any creatures observing the fire or the dancing circle of flame around it must successfully roll a saving throw vs. spell or be charmed into remaining motionless and gazing, transfixed, at the flames. While so charmed, creatures are subject to suggestions of 12 or fewer words, saving vs. spell with a -3 penalty, adjusted for Wisdom. The caster can give one such suggestion to each creature, and the suggestions need not be the same. The maximum duration for such a suggestion is one hour, regardless of the caster's level.

The fire charm is broken if the charmed creature is physically attacked, if a solid object comes between the creature and the veil of flames so as to obstruct vision, or when the duration of the spell expires. Those exposed to the fire charm again may be affected at the DMs option, although bonuses may also be allowed to the saving throws. 

Note that the veil of flame is not a magical fire, and passing through it incurs the same damage as would be sustained from passing through its original fire source.

The material component for this spell is a small piece of multi-colored silk of exceptional thinness that the spellcaster must throw into the fire source."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell can be cast in one of two forms: a warm shield that protects against cold-based attacks, or a chill shield that protects against fire-based attacks. Both return damage to creatures making physical attacks against the wizard. The wizard must choose which variation he memorizes when the spell is selected.

When casting this spell, the wizard appears to immolate himself, but the flames are thin and wispy, shedding no heat, though giving light equal to only half the illumination of a normal torch. The color of the flames is determined randomly (50% chance of either color) - blue or green if the chill shield is cast, violet or blue if the warm shield is employed. The special powers of each shield are as follows:

A) Warmshield. The flames are warm to the touch. Any cold-based attacks are saved against with a +2 bonus; either half normal damage or no damage is sustained. There is no bonus against fire-based attacks, but if the wizard fails to make the required saving throw (if any) against them, he sustains double normal damage.

The material component for this variation is a bit of phosphorus.

B) Chill shield. The flames are cool to the touch. Any fire-based attacks are saved against with a +2 bonus; either half normal damage or no damage is sustained. There is no bonus against cold-based attacks, but if the wizard fails to make the required saving throw (if any) against them, he sustains double normal damage.

The material component for this variation is a live firefly or glow worm or the tail portions of four dead ones.

Any creature striking the spellcaster with its body or hand-held weapons inflicts normal damage upon the wizard, but the attacker suffers the same amount of damage. An attacker's magical resistance, if any, is tested when the creature actually strikes the wizard. Successful resistance shatters the spell. Failure means the creature's magic resistance does not affect that casting of the spell.

"description":"By means of this spell, the wizard causes an illusion that hides the actual terrain within the area of effect. 
Thus open fields or a road can be made to look like a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to look like a grassy meadow, a precipice look like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully made to look like a wide and smooth road. 

The hallucinatory terrain persists until a dispel magic spell is cast upon the area or until the duration expires. Individual creatures may see through the illusion, but the illusion persists, affecting others who observe the scene.

If the illusion involves only a subtle change, such as causing an open wood to appear thick and dark, or increasing the slope of a hill, the effect may be unnoticed even by those in the midst of it. If the change is extreme, a grassy plain covering a seething field of volcanic mudpots, for instance, the illusion will no doubt be noticed the instant one person falls prey to it. 

Each level of experience expands the dimensions of the area affected, e.g., a 12th-level caster affects a 120yd. x 120yd. x 120yd. area.

The material components of this spell are a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant-leaf or grass blade."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">By means of this spell, the wizard causes an illusion that hides the actual terrain within the area of effect. <br />Thus open fields or a road can be made to look like a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to look like a grassy meadow, a precipice look like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully made to look like a wide and smooth road. <br /><br />The hallucinatory terrain persists until a dispel magic spell is cast upon the area or until the duration expires. Individual creatures may see through the illusion, but the illusion persists, affecting others who observe the scene.<br /><br />If the illusion involves only a subtle change, such as causing an open wood to appear thick and dark, or increasing the slope of a hill, the effect may be unnoticed even by those in the midst of it. If the change is extreme, a grassy plain covering a seething field of volcanic mudpots, for instance, the illusion will no doubt be noticed the instant one person falls prey to it. <br /><br />Each level of experience expands the dimensions of the area affected, e.g., a 12th-level caster affects a 120yd. x 120yd. x 120yd. area.<br /><br />The material components of this spell are a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant-leaf or grass blade.</div>

"description":"By casting this spell, the wizard can empower a creature with superhuman strength. Unlike the 2nd-level strength spell, improved strength allows the recipient of the spell to ignore race or class restrictions on his maximum Strength score, possibly reaching scores as high as 25. The exact amount of strength gained varies by the recipient’s class group:

Class    Strength   Gain*
Warrior  1d8+4      (max 25)
Priest   1d6+4      (max 23)
Rogue    1d6+4      (max 23)
Wizard   1d4+4      (max 21)

In addition to the attack and damage bonus, increased chance to open doors or bend bars, and increased carrying capacity, the spell recipient may temporarily gain the ability to throw boulders as a giant of equivalent Strength, as shown below:

"description":"This spell is similar to the 7th-level spell turning, which causes spells cast against the wizard to rebound on the original caster. This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the protected wizard, spell effects delivered by touch, and spell effects from devices such as wands, staves, and so forth. Thus, a light spell cast to blind the protected wizard could be turned back upon and possibly blind the caster, while the same spell would be unaffected if cast to light an area in which the protected wizard were standing.

One to four (1d4) spell levels may be turned. The exact number is secretly rolled by the DM; the player never knows how effective the spell is.

Unlike the 7th level version of this spell, minor spell turning is not capable of partially turning a spell. For example, if a wizard has three levels of spell turning, he can turn three 1st-level spells, one 1st and one 2nd, or one 3rd-level spell. He can in no way turn spells of 4th level or above. If the caster is the target of a spell of a higher level than he is capable of turning, the caster receives the full brunt of the spell.

			<div class="description">
				<div class="description-content">This spell is similar to the 7th-level spell turning, which causes spells cast against the wizard to rebound on the original caster. This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the protected wizard, spell effects delivered by touch, and spell effects from devices such as wands, staves, and so forth. Thus, a light spell cast to blind the protected wizard could be turned back upon and possibly blind the caster, while the same spell would be unaffected if cast to light an area in which the protected wizard were standing.<br /><br />One to four (1d4) spell levels may be turned. The exact number is secretly rolled by the DM; the player never knows how effective the spell is.<br /><br />Unlike the 7th level version of this spell, minor spell turning is not capable of partially turning a spell. For example, if a wizard has three levels of spell turning, he can turn three 1st-level spells, one 1st and one 2nd, or one 3rd-level spell. He can in no way turn spells of 4th level or above. If the caster is the target of a spell of a higher level than he is capable of turning, the caster receives the full brunt of the spell.<br /><br />If the protected wizard and a spellcasting attacker both have spell turning effects operating, a resonating field is created that has the following effects. (See book for table).<br /><br />The material component of this spell is a smoothly polished silver coin.</div>

Only the spell recipient can see the phantasmal killer (the caster sees only a shadowy shape), but if it succeeds in scoring a hit, the subject dies from fright. 

The beast attacks as a 4 Hit Dice monster. It is invulnerable to all attacks, and it can pass through any barriers. Once cast, it inexorably pursues the subject, for it exists only in the subject's mind.

The only defenses against a phantasmal killer are an attempt to disbelieve (which can be tried but once), slaying or rendering unconscious the wizard who cast the spell, or rendering unconscious the target of the spell for its duration. 

To disbelieve the killer, the subject must specifically state the attempt and then roll an Intelligence check. This roll has a -1 penalty for every four levels of the caster. Special modifiers apply to this attack:

If surprised, the roll is modified -2;
If the subject has previously been attack by this spell, the roll is modified +1;
If the subject is an illusionist, the roll is modified +2;
If the subject is wearing a helm of telepathy, the roll is modified +3;

Magic resistance, bonuses against fear, and Wisdom adjustments also apply. 

Magic resistance is checked first to determine Spell operation, and then the fear/Wisdom bonus applies as a minus to the dice roll to match or score less than Intelligence.

If the subject of a phantasmal killer attack succeeds in disbelieving, and he is wearing a helm of telepathy, the beast can be turned upon the wizard, who must then disbelieve it or be subject to its attack and possible effects.

If the subject ignores the killer to perform other actions, such as attacking the caster, the killer may, at the DMs option, gain bonuses to hit (for flank or rear attacks, etc.). Spells such as remove fear and cloak of bravery, cast after the killer has attacked, grant another check to disbelieve the effect."}</textarea>

"description":"The polymorph other spell is a powerful magic that completely alters the form and ability, and possibly the personality and mentality, of the recipient. Of course, while a creature with a lower Intelligence can be polymorphed in form into something with a higher Intelligence, it will not gain that creature's mental ability. 

The reverse - polymorphing a higher Intelligence creature into one of significantly lower Intelligence - results in a creature much more intelligent than appearances would lead one to believe. The polymorphed creature must succeed on a system shock (see Table 3) roll to see if it survives the change. After this, it must make a special Intelligence check to see if it retains its personality (see following).

The polymorphed creature acquires the and physical abilities of the creature it has been polymorphed into, while retaining its own mind. Form includes natural Armor Class (that due to skin toughness, but not due to quickness, magical nature, etc.), physical movement abilities (walking, swimming, flight with wings, but not plane shifting, blinking, teleporting, etc.), and attack routines (claw/claw/bite, swoop, rake, constriction, but not petrification, breath weapons, energy drain, etc.).

Hit points and saving throws do not change from the original form. Noncorporeal forms cannot be assumed. Natural shapeshifters (lycanthropes, doppelgangers, higher level druids, etc.) are affected for but one round, and can then resume their normal form.
If slain, the polymorphed creature reverts to its original form (it's still dead, though). (Note that most creatures generally prefer their own form and will not willingly stand the risk of being subjected to this spell!) As class and level are not attributes of form, abilities derived from either cannot be gained by this spell, nor can exact ability scores be specified.

When the polymorph occurs, the creature's equipment, if any, melds into the new form (in particularly challenging campaigns, the DM may allow protective devices, such as a ring of protection, to continue operating effectively). The creature retains its mental abilities, including spell use, assuming the new form allows completion of the proper verbal and somatic components and the material components are available. Creatures not used to a new form might be penalized at the DM's option (e.g., -2 to attack rolls) until they practice sufficiently to master it.

When the physical change occurs, there is a base 100% chance that the subjects personality and mentality change into that of new form (i.e., a roll of 20 or less on 1d20). For each 1 point of Intelligence of the subject, subtract 1 from the base chance on 1d20. Additionally, for every Hit Die of difference between the original form and the form it is assuming, add or subtract 1 (depending on whether polymorphed form has more Hit Dice [or levels) or fewer Hit Dice [or levels] than original, respectively). The chance for assumption of the personality and mentality of the new form is checked daily until the change takes place.

A subject acquiring the mentality of the new form has effectively become the creature whose form was assumed and comes under the control of the DM until recovered by a wish spell or similar magic. Once this final change takes place, the creature acquires the new form's full range of magical and special abilities.

Example: If a 1 Hit Die orc of 8 Intelligence is polymorphed into a white dragon with 6 Hit Dice, for example, it is 85% (20- 8 Intelligence + 5 levels difference [16-1]=17 out of 20= 85%) likely to actually become one in all respects, but in any case it has the dragon's physical and mental capabilities. If it does not assume the personality and mentality of a white dragon, it knows what it formerly knew as well.

The wizard can use a dispel magic spell to change the polymorphed creature back to its original form, and this requires a system shock roll. Those who have lost their individuality and are then converted back maintain the belief that they are actually the polymorphed creature and attempt to return to that form. Thus, the orc who comes to believe he is a white dragon, when converted back to his orc form, steadfastly maintains he is really a white dragon polymorphed into the shape of an orc. His companions will most likely consider him mad.

The material component of this spell is a caterpillar cocoon."}</textarea>

Once this final change takes place, the creature acquires the new form&#039;s full range of magical and special abilities.<br /><br />Example: If a 1 Hit Die orc of 8 Intelligence is polymorphed into a white dragon with 6 Hit Dice, for example, it is 85% (20- 8 Intelligence + 5 levels difference [16-1]=17 out of 20= 85%) likely to actually become one in all respects, but in any case it has the dragon&#039;s physical and mental capabilities. If it does not assume the personality and mentality of a white dragon, it knows what it formerly knew as well.<br /><br />The wizard can use a dispel magic spell to change the polymorphed creature back to its original form, and this requires a system shock roll. Those who have lost their individuality and are then converted back maintain the belief that they are actually the polymorphed creature and attempt to return to that form. Thus, the orc who comes to believe he is a white dragon, when converted back to his orc form, steadfastly maintains he is really a white dragon polymorphed into the shape of an orc. His companions will most likely consider him mad.<br /><br />The material component of this spell is a caterpillar cocoon.</div>

When the polymorph occurs, the caster's equipment, if any, melds into the new form (in particularly challenging campaigns, the DM may allow protective devices, such as a ring of protection, to continue operating effectively). The caster retains all mental abilities, including spell use, assuming the new form allows completion of the proper verbal and somatic components and the material components are available.

The spellcaster can change his form as often as desired for the duration of the spell, each change requiring a round. The wizard retains his own hit points, attack rolls, and saving throws. The wizard can end the spell at any time; when voluntarily returning to his own form and ending the spell, he regains 1d12 hit points. The wizard also will return to his own form when slain or when the effect is dispelled, but no hit points are restored in these cases."}</textarea>

"description":"A wizard casting the shadow monsters spell uses material from the plane of Shadow to shape semi-real illusions of one or more monsters. The total Hit Dice of the shadow monster or monsters thus created cannot exceed the level of experience of the wizard; thus a 10th-level wizard can create one creature that has 10 Hit Dice, two that have 5 Hit Dice, etc. All shadow monsters created by one spell must be of the same sort.

The actual hit point total for each monster is 20% of the hit point total it would normally have. (To determine this, roll the appropriate Hit Dice and multiply the hit points by 0.2. Any remainder less than 0.4 is dropped - in the case of monsters with 1 or fewer Hit Dice, this indicates the monster was not successfully created - and scores between .4 and 1 are rounded up to 1 hit point.)
Those viewing the shadow monsters are allowed to disbelieve as per normal illusions, although there is a -2 penalty to the attempt. The shadow monsters perform as the real monsters with respect to Armor Class and attack forms. Those who believe in the shadow monsters suffer real damage from their attacks. Special attack forms such as petrification or level drain do not actually occur, but a subject who believes they are real will react appropriately.

Those who roll successful saving throws see the shadow monsters as transparent images superimposed on vague shadowy forms. These are Armor Class 10 and inflict only 20% of normal melee damage (biting, clawing, weapon, etc.), dropping fractional damage less than 0.4 as done with hit points.

Example: A shadow monster griffon attacks a person who knows it is only quasi-real. The monster strikes with two claw attacks and one bite, hitting as a 7-Hit Die monster. All three attacks hit, and the normal damage dice are rolled, multiplied by 0.2 separately, rounded up or down, then added together to get total damage. Thus if the attacks score 4, 2, and 11 points, then a total of 4 points of damage is inflicted (4 x 0.2 = 0.8 [rounded to 1], 2 x 0.2 = 0.4 [rounded to 1], 11 x 0.2 = 2.2 [rounded to 2]. The sum is 1 + 1 + 2 = 4)."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">A wizard casting the shadow monsters spell uses material from the plane of Shadow to shape semi-real illusions of one or more monsters. The total Hit Dice of the shadow monster or monsters thus created cannot exceed the level of experience of the wizard; thus a 10th-level wizard can create one creature that has 10 Hit Dice, two that have 5 Hit Dice, etc. All shadow monsters created by one spell must be of the same sort.<br /><br />The actual hit point total for each monster is 20% of the hit point total it would normally have. (To determine this, roll the appropriate Hit Dice and multiply the hit points by 0.2. Any remainder less than 0.4 is dropped - in the case of monsters with 1 or fewer Hit Dice, this indicates the monster was not successfully created - and scores between .4 and 1 are rounded up to 1 hit point.)<br />Those viewing the shadow monsters are allowed to disbelieve as per normal illusions, although there is a -2 penalty to the attempt. The shadow monsters perform as the real monsters with respect to Armor Class and attack forms. Those who believe in the shadow monsters suffer real damage from their attacks. Special attack forms such as petrification or level drain do not actually occur, but a subject who believes they are real will react appropriately.<br /><br />Those who roll successful saving throws see the shadow monsters as transparent images superimposed on vague shadowy forms. These are Armor Class 10 and inflict only 20% of normal melee damage (biting, clawing, weapon, etc.), dropping fractional damage less than 0.4 as done with hit points.<br /><br />Example: A shadow monster griffon attacks a person who knows it is only quasi-real.

The reverse of this spell ,turn boulder to pebble, shrinks a boulder to the size of a pebble. It affects only naturally occurring rocks and can not be used to shrink a statue or a cut gemstone.

The number of rocks that may be affected is equal to the number of experience levels of the caster. Boulders must not exceed one cubic foot per level of the caster. Thus, a 10th-level wizard could shrink 10 rocks, each of which is equal to or less than 10 cubic feet in size. All rocks are affected in the same round the spell is cast. Though they need not be touched, the boulders must be within 50 feet of the caster. Boulders that have been shrunk remain so until dispelled."}</textarea>

Boulders must not exceed one cubic foot per level of the caster. Thus, a 10th-level wizard could shrink 10 rocks, each of which is equal to or less than 10 cubic feet in size. All rocks are affected in the same round the spell is cast. Though they need not be touched, the boulders must be within 50 feet of the caster. Boulders that have been shrunk remain so until dispelled.</div>

"description":"This spell can be cast in one of three ways: as an anchored plane of ice, as a hemisphere, or as a horizontal sheet to fall upon creatures with the effect of an ice storm.

A) Ice plane. When this spell is cast, a sheet of strong, hard ice is created. The wall is primarily defensive, stopping pursuers and the like. The wall is 1 inch thick per level of experience of the wizard. It covers a 10-foot-square area per level (a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, etc.). 
Any creature breaking through the ice suffers 2 points of damage per inch of thickness of the wall. Fire-using creatures suffer 3 points of damage per inch, while cold using creatures suffer only 1 point of damage per inch when breaking through. The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored along one or more sides.

B) Hemisphere. This casting of the spell creates a hemisphere whose maximum radius is equal to 3 feet plus 1 foot per caster level. Thus, a 7th-level caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius. The hemisphere lasts until it is broken, dispelled, or melted. Note that it is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents under the hemisphere.

C) Ice sheet. This casting of the spell causes a horizontal sheet to fall upon opponents. The sheet covers a 10-foot-square area per caster level. The sheet has the same effect as an ice storm's hail stones - 3d10 points of damage inflicted to creatures beneath it.

A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures; its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Magical fires such as fireballs and fiery dragon breath melt a wall of ice in one round, though this creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts one turn. Normal fires or lesser magical ones do not hasten the melting of a wall of ice.

The material component of this spell is a small piece of quartz or similar rock crystal."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell creates the lowest of the undead monsters - skeletons or zombies - usually from the bones or bodies of dead humans, demihumans, or humanoids. The spell causes existing remains to become animated and obey the simple verbal commands of the caster. 
The skeletons or zombies can follow the caster, remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific type of creature) entering the place, etc. The undead remain animated until they are destroyed in combat or are turned; the magic cannot be dispelled. The following types of dead creatures can be animated:

A) Humans, demihumans, and humanoids with 1 Hit Die. The wizard can animate one skeleton for each experience level he has attained, or one zombie for every two levels. The experience levels, if any, of the slain are ignored: the body of a newly dead 9th-level fighter is animated as a zombie with 2 Hit Dice, without special class or racial abilities.

B) Creatures with more than 1 Hit Die. The number of undead animated is determined by the monster Hit Dice (the total Hit Dice cannot exceed the wizards level). Skeletal forms have the Hit Dice of the original creature, while zombie forms have one more Hit Die. Thus, a 12th-level wizard could animate four zombie gnolls (4 x [2 + 1 Hit Dice]= 12), or a single fire giant skeleton. Such undead have none of the special abilities they had in life.

C) Creatures with less than 1 Hit Die. The caster can animate two skeletons per level or one zombie per level. The creatures have their normal Hit Dice as skeletons and an additional Hit Die as zombies, Clerics receive a +1 bonus when trying to turn these.

This spell assumes that the bodies or bones are available and are reasonably intact (those of skeletons or zombies destroyed in combat won't be!).

It requires a drop of blood and a pinch of bone powder or a bone shard to complete the spell. 

The casting of this spell is not a good act and only evil wizards use it frequently."}</textarea>

A moderate breeze causes it to alter course (roll for direction), but it does not move back toward its caster. A strong wind breaks it up in four rounds, and a greater wind force prevents the use of the spell. Very thick vegetation will disperse the cloud in two rounds. 

As the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pour down den or sinkhole openings; thus the spell is ideal for slaying nests of giant ants, for example.

A moderate breeze causes it to alter course (roll for direction), but it does not move back toward its caster. A strong wind breaks it up in four rounds, and a greater wind force prevents the use of the spell. Very thick vegetation will disperse the cloud in two rounds. <br /><br />As the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pour down den or sinkhole openings; thus the spell is ideal for slaying nests of giant ants, for example. <br /><br />It cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater.</div>

"description":"When this spell is cast, the wizard sends his mind to another plane of existence in order to receive advice and information from powers there. As these powers resent such contact, only brief answers are given. (The DM answers all questions with \"yes,\" \"no,\" \"maybe,\" \"never,\" \"irrelevant,\" etc.) Any questions asked are answered by the power during the spell's duration. The character can contact an elemental plane or some plane farther removed. For every two levels of experience of the wizard, one question may be asked. Contact with minds far removed from the plane of the wizard increases the probability of the spellcaster going insane or dying, but the chance of the power knowing the answer, as well as the probability of the being telling the correct answer, are likewise increased by moving to distant planes. Once the Outer Planes are reached, the Intelligence of the power contacted determines the effects.

The accompanying random table is subject to DM changes, development of extraplanar NPC beings, and so on.

If insanity occurs, it strikes as soon as the first question is asked. This condition lasts for one week for each removal of the plane contacted (see the DMG or the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set), to a maximum of 10 weeks. There is a 1% chance per plane that the wizard dies before recovering, unless a remove curse spell is cast upon him. A surviving wizard can recall the answer to the question.

On rare occasions, this divination may be blocked by the action of certain lesser or greater powers.

Plane               Insanity *  Knowledge  Veracity **
Elemental Plane     20%         55% (90%)  62% (75%)
Inner Plane         25%         60%        65%
Astral Plane        30%         65%        67%
Outer Plane, Int 19 35%         70%        70%
Outer Plane, Int 20 40%         75%        73%
Outer Plane, Int 21 45%         80%        75%
Outer Plane, Int 22 50%         85%        78%
Outer Plane, Int 23 55%         90%        81%
Outer Plane, Int 24 60%         95%        85%
Outer Plane, Int 25 65%         98%        90%

* For every point of Intelligence over 15, the wizard reduces the chance of insanity by 5%.
** If the being does not know an answer, and the chance of veracity is not made, the being will emphatically give an incorrect answer. If the chance of veracity is made, the being will answer “unknown.”

Percentages in parentheses are for questions that pertain to the appropriate elemental plane.

Optional Rule
The DM may allow a specific Outer Plane to be contacted (see the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set). In this case, the difference in alignment between the caster and the plane contacted alters the maximum Intelligence that can be contacted--each difference in moral or ethical alignment lowers the maximum Intelligence that can be contacted by 1. For example, an 18th-level lawful good caster could contact Mount Celestia (a lawful good plane) on the \"Intelligence 20\" line, or Elysium (a neutral good plane) on the \"Intelligence 19\" line."}</textarea>

"description":"The dream spell enables the caster, or a messenger touched by the caster, to send messages to others in the form of dreams. At the beginning of the spell, the caster must name the recipient or identify him by some title that leaves no doubt as to his identity.

As the caster completes the spell, the person sending the spell falls into a deep trancelike sleep, and instantaneously projects his mind to the recipient. The sender then enters the recipient's dream and delivers the message unless the recipient is magically protected. If the recipient is awake, the message sender can choose to remain in the trancelike sleep. If the sender is disturbed during this time, the spell is immediately cancelled and the sender comes out of the trance. The whereabouts and current activities of the recipient cannot be learned through this spell.

The sender is unaware of his own surroundings or the activities around him while he is in his trance. He is totally defenseless, both physically and mentally (i.e., he always fails any saving throw) while in the trance. Once the recipient's dreams are entered, the sender can deliver a message of any length, which the recipient remembers perfectly upon waking. The communication is one-way; the recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the sender gain any information by observing the dreams of the recipient. Once the message is delivered, the sender's mind returns instantly to his body. The duration of the spell is the time required for the sender to enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message.

The reverse of this spell, nightmare, enables the caster to send a hideous and unsettling vision to the recipient, who is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. The nightmare prevents restful sleep and causes 1d10 points of damage. The nightmare leaves the recipient fatigued and unable to regain spells for the next day. A dispel evil spell cast upon the recipient stuns the caster of the nightmare for one turn per level of the cleric countering this evil sending."}</textarea>

"description":"Naturally, this spell is an improvement of the 3rd-level alteration spell blink, allowing the wizard to shift his body to any point within 15 feet of his current location. Unlike the lower-level spell, improved blink allows the wizard to choose the exact time of his jump, the exact destination, and the orientation or facing of his choosing. For example, a wizard confronted by an enemy fighter could blink just before the fighter attacked, reappearing directly behind his foe for a back attack. If the wizard blinks away from an attack, his enemy automatically misses - but creatures with multiple attacks may be able to reposition themselves for another swing if the wizard blinks to a location within reach.

If the wizard intends to take any action such as attacking, casting a spell, or using a magical item, he must decide before the round begins if he will do so before or after he blinks. If he acts before he blinks, he may be endangered by an attack before he finishes; he can choose to proceed with his action, hoping that he won’t be hit, or he can abort his action by taking his blink for the round. On the other hand, if the wizard begins his action after his blink, the initiative modifier of his attack or spell is added to the time of his blink to determine when he attacks.

A blinking wizard dueling a fighter decides to blink first, when the fighter attacks and then lightning bolt the offensive fellow. The fighter rolls a modified 6 for initiative, so the wizard waits until 6, then blinks, making the fighter miss. At that time, he starts his lightning bolt, which has a casting time of 3-the spell will go off on 9.

In the Player’s Option: Combat & Tactics initiative system, the wizard must count 1, 2, or 3 phases from the time of his blink for fast, average, or slow actions. If the fighter above attacked in the average phase, the wizard would blink during the fighter’s attack, and then his lightning bolt (a fast spell) would go off 1 phase later, with any other slow actions.

Because the wizard can pick the location he is blinking to, he may not choose to blink into a movable object in order to force it aside - he must blink to an area clear of obstructions or obstacles. If he does attempt to blink into a movable object, he will find himself displaced to a random location (use the blink 1d8 rules in the PHB for determining where he ends up)."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell allows the caster to more easily access rare or dangerous spell components. The wizard casts this spell upon a silver mirror while concentrating on a mental image of the material he desires. The base chance of success is 50%, modified by the following factors:

+1% per level of the caster
+10% if the caster has seen the same type of substance or object before; this bonus is not cumulative with the following bonus
+20% if the caster has a sample of the material or the same type of object in his possession; this bonus is not cumulative with the bonus above
+30% if the wizard knows the location of the desired object
-50% if the caster has never seen the same type of material or item before

If the percentile roll indicates failure, the caster is unable to locate the desired ingredient and the spell ends. If the roll indicates success, the wizard has located the object or substance and the mirror becomes a magical gate through which the caster can see the target. The size of the gate is determined by the size of the mirror, to a maximum size of 3 feet by 2 feet.

The gate always appears within arm's length of the target, allowing the wizard to reach through the mirror, grasp the object of his desire, and draw it back through the gate. The wizard must risk his own safety--the gate does not allow the use of probes, long-handled ladles, tongs, or other equipment to gather the material. The caster cannot move completely through the gate.

The gate vanishes when the spell's duration expires or when the target or the wizard moves more than 10' away from it.

The gate is visible from both sides, and other creatures can reach through the gate. Breath weapons, gaze attacks, missiles, spells, and similar attacks cannot be cast through the gate. Because creatures can pass their limbs through the gate, physical attacks and touch spells can be used.

The only limit to the range of this spell is that the caster and the target must be on the same plane of existence. Elemental forces (not creatures) will not pass through the gate. Thus, the wizard does not run the risk of flooding his laboratory by opening a gate beneath the sea, for example. However, the spell does not provide any sort of protection against a hostile environment.

The material components are an exquisite silver mirror of no less than 10,000 gp value and a black opal worth at least 1,000 gp which must be powdered and sprinkled on the mirror. The mirror is not lost after casting and may be used again, but the powdered opal is consumed in the casting."}</textarea>

"description":"This devious spell distracts the subject creatures by drawing them into an absorbing discussion on topics of interest to them. A chain of responses occurs during the next 11 rounds, with additional saving throws as described later. These responses are conversation (rounds 1-3), possible confusion (rounds 4-6), and then either rage or lamentation (rounds 7-11). All saving throws are affected by the creatures' Intelligences, as noted later. The subject creatures must be able to understand the language in which the spellcaster speaks.

Upon casting the spell, the wizard begins discussion of some topic germane to the creature or creatures to be affected. Those making a successful saving throw vs. spell are unaffected. Affected creatures immediately begin to converse with the spellcaster, agreeing or disagreeing, all most politely. As long as the spellcaster chooses, he can maintain the spell by conversing with the subject(s). If the caster is attacked or otherwise distracted, the subject creatures do not notice.

The wizard can leave at any time after the casting and the subject(s) continue on as if the caster were still present. As long as they are not attacked, the creatures ignore all else going on around them, spending their time talking and arguing to the exclusion of other activities. However, when the caster leaves, each subject completes only the stage of the spell that it is currently in, and then the spell is broken.

If the caster maintains the spell for more than three rounds, each affected creature can roll another saving throw vs. spell. Those failing to save wander off in confusion for 1d10+2 rounds, staying away from the spellcaster. Those who make this saving throw continue to talk and roll saving throws for each round that the caster continues the spell, up through the sixth round, to avoid the confusion effect.

If the spell is maintained for more than six rounds, each subject must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell to avoid going into a rage, attacking all other subjects of the spell with intent to kill. This rage lasts for 1d4+1 rounds. Those who successfully save against the rage effect realize that they have been deceived and collapse to the ground, lamenting their foolishness, for 1d4 rounds unless attacked or otherwise disturbed."}</textarea>

"description":"The magic jar spell enables the caster to shift his life force into a special receptacle (a gem or large crystal). From there the caster can force an exchange of life forces between the receptacle and another creature, thus enabling the wizard to take over and control the body of another creature, while the life force of the host is confined in the receptacle. The special life force receptacle must be within spell range of the wizard's body at the time of spellcasting. The wizard's life force shifts into the receptacle in the round in which the casting is completed, allowing no other actions.

While in the magic jar, the caster can sense and attack any life force within a 10-footper- level radius (on the same plane); however, the exact creature types and relative physical positions cannot be determined. In a group of life forces, the caster can sense a difference of four or more levels/Hit Dice and can determine whether a life force is positive or negative energy.

For example, if two 10th-level fighters are attacking a hill giant and four ogres, the caster could determine that there are three stronger and four weaker life forces within range, all with positive life energy. The caster could try to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but he has no control over exactly which creature is attacked.

An attempt to take over a host body requires a full round. It is blocked by a protection from evil spell or similar ward. It is successful only if the subject fails a saving throw vs. spell with a special modifier (see following). The saving throw is modified by subtracting the combined Intelligence and Wisdom scores of the target from those of the wizard

(Intelligence and Hit Dice in nonhuman or nonhumanoid creatures). This modifier is added to (or subtracted from) the die roll. (See book for table).

A negative score indicates that the wizard has a lower total than the target; thus, the host has a saving throw bonus. Failure to take over the host leaves the wizard's life force in the magic jar.

If successful, the caster's life force occupies the host body and the host's life force is confined in the magic jar receptacle. The caster can call upon rudimentary or instinctive knowledge of the subject creature, but not upon its real or acquired knowledge (i.e., the wizard does not automatically know the language or spells of the creature). The caster retains his own attack rolls, class knowledge and training, and any adjustments due to his Intelligence or Wisdom. If the host body is human or humanoid, and the necessary spell components are available, the wizard can even use his memorized spells. The host body retains its own hit points and physical abilities and properties. The DM decides if any additional modifications are necessary; for example, perhaps clumsiness or inefficiency occurs if the caster must become used to the new form. The alignment of the host or receptacle is that of the occupying life force.

The caster can shift freely from the host to the receptacle if within the 10-foot-per-level range. Each attempt to shift requires one round. The spell ends when the wizard shifts from the jar to his own body.

A successful dispel magic spell cast on the host can drive the caster of the magic jar spell back into the receptacle and prevent him from making any attacks for 1d4 rounds plus 1 round per level of the caster of the dispel. The base success chance is 50%, plus or minus 5% per level difference between the casters. A successful dispel magic cast against the receptacle forces the occupant back into his own body. If the wizard who cast the magic jar is forced back into his own body, the spell ends.

If the host body is slain, the caster returns to the receptacle, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (i.e., it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both the host and the caster die.

Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain unless recalled by a raise dead, resurrection, or similar spell.

If the body of the caster is slain, his life force survives if it is in either the receptacle or the host. If the receptacle is destroyed while the caster's life force occupies it, the caster is irrevocably slain."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell allows a wizard's staff to store one spell level for every three levels of the caster. Thus, a 9th level wizard can store three spell levels (three 1st level spells, one 1st and 2nd, or one 3rd level spell).

Spells that are to be stored in the staff must be memorized normally by the wizard. The spells are then cast as normal when charging the staff; casting requires the spell's normal casting time plus one round. The spell is wiped from memory and material components are consumed. All spells to be stored must be cast into the staff within 1 turn.

All stored spells have a casting time of 1.

Spells remain in the staff until cast or dispelled, or up to 1 hour per level of the caster. After this time, all stored spells fade away.

Only wizards who know the magic staff spell can cast spells from another wizard's staff. This applies to wizards who have never learned or could not normally cast the spells stored in a staff. It is common, however, for the staff's owner to implement a command word which must be known by anyone wishing to use the staff.

The material component for this spell is a staff cut from an ash tree. For each spell level the wizard intends to imbue into the staff, it must be inlaid with rubies worth at least 1000gp."}</textarea>

"description":"The renowned fire wizard Daltim developed this spell some years ago to protect important items or structures against the various incendiary spells with which he was familiar. Proofing renders an inanimate object nearly impervious to fire, granting the affected item a +3 bonus to saving throws vs. magical fire (including a dragon's breath), and a +6 bonus to saving throws vs. normal fire. This is cumulative with the saving throw bonus of a magical item, so a cloak of protection +4 could have a bonus of +7 to +10 on any item saving throws versus combustion effects. Remember that an item fails its saving throw on a natural roll of 1, regardless of any bonuses.

The item affected must be one discrete construction or object, although it can be articulated or composed of several parts (for example, a suit of armor, a catapult, a house, or a carriage). At 9th level, the wizard can proof an article of clothing or a small piece of furniture; at 12th level, a small vehicle or large piece of furniture; at 15th level, a small building or large vehicle; at 18th level, a medium building or a very large vehicle; and at 20th level or higher, a large building or small fortification. A character dressed in a completely proofed article of clothing (a large cloak) gains a +2 bonus to saving throws vs. fire.

The material component for proofing versus combustion is a fire-brick made with the ashes left from a phoenix’s fire. Seafaring wizards often use this spell to protect their vessels from hostile fireballs and various fire-throwing devices."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell conjures a small horde of semi-tangible magical orbs or eyes that can be used to reconnoiter an area at the wizard's command. Each of the eyes is about the size of a small apple and can see 120 feet(normal vision only) in all  direction. In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to the caster's hand to replay in the caster's mind everything they have seen during their existence. The eyes are subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect the wizard's ability to receive visual information about his surroundings. The eyes only see as a normal human would-abilities and spell effects including infravision do not alter the eyes' vision. It only takes the eye one round to replay one hour of recorded images.

The spell conjures 1d4 eyes, plus 1 eye per caster level. The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level, or until they return to the wizard; after relaying its findings, an eye disappears. Each eye is AC 16, flies by levitation at a rate of 12,and has only 1 hit point - a single hit from any weapon or damaging spell destroys it. A successful dispel magic destroys all eyes caught in the area of effect. While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they're small and difficult to spot, especially in conditions of poor visibility such as darkness, fog, or rain. Of course, if the eye is being sent into darkness, then it's very possible that it could hit a wall or other similar obstacle and destroy itself.

When the wizard creates the eyes, he can specify any set of instruction or orders that he wishes, up to 25 words. Any knowledge the wizard possesses is assumed to be know by the eyes as well, so if the wizard knows what a typical Jakallian merchant looks like, the eyes do as well. Sample commands might be, \"Surround me at a range of 400 yards and return if you spot any dangerous creatures,\" or \"Spread out and search the town for Arweth; follow him for three turns, staying out of sight, and then return.\" Note that in the first command, the eye only returns if it spots a creature that the wizard would regard as dangerous; a seemingly innocuous peasant that is actually a shapechanged dragon wouldn't trigger the eye's return. In any event, if an eye is ever more than one mile distant from the wizard, it instantly ceases to exist. However, the wizard's link with the eye is such that he won't know if eye was destroyed or if just wandered out of range.  

Some command words can be used to abbreviate the direction. For example, \"surround me\" directs the eyes to form an equally-spaced ring at whatever range is indicated, and then move with the wizard. As eyes return or are destroyed, the rest automatically space themselves to compensate. \"Spread out\" directs the eyes to move away from the wizard in all directions. Other commands that might be useful include having them form a line in a certain manner, making them move at random within a certain range, or have them follow a certain type of creature. The DM is the final judge of the suitability of the wizard's directions.

				<div class="description-content">By casting this spell, the wizard gains the power to corrode ferrous metals and alloys at a touch. Iron and iron-based alloys such as steel, meteoric iron, mithral, and adamantite are affected, but noble metals such as gold, silver, and copper are not subject to reduction through rusting. Any ferrous metal touched by the wizard must make an item saving throw vs. disintegration (usually a 17 or better on a d20) or be destroyed. Magical arms or armor may apply their bonus to this save, so a sword +3 would gain a +3 to its roll. Other magical metal items may receive a +1 to a +6 bonus based on the DM</div>

The spellcaster is able to teleport a maximum weight of 250 pounds, plus an additional 150 pounds for each level of experience above the 10th (a 13th-level wizard can teleport up to 700 pounds).

Lesser known areas (those seen only magically or from a distance) increase the probability of error. Unfamiliar areas present considerable peril (see table).

Teleporting high means the wizard arrives 10 feet above the ground for every 1% he is below the lowest \"On Target\" probability; this could be as high as 320 feet if the destination area was never seen. Any low result means the instant death of the wizard if the area into which he teleports is solid.

"description":"By means of this spell, the wizard surrounds himself with an invisible barrier that moves with him. The space within this barrier is totally impervious to all magic and magical spell effects, thus preventing the passage of spells or their effects. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magical items or spells within its confines. The area is also impervious to breath weapons, gaze or voice attacks, and similar special attack forms.

The antimagic shell also hedges out charmed, summoned, or conjured creatures. It cannot, however, be forced against any creature that it would keep at bay; any attempt to do so creates a discernible pressure against the barrier, and continued pressure will break the spell. Normal creatures (a normally encountered troll rather than a conjured one, for instance) can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magical sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword. Note that creatures on their home plane are normal creatures there. Thus, on the Elemental Plane of Fire, a randomly encountered fire elemental cannot be kept at bay by this spell. Artifacts, relics, and creatures of demigod or higher status are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.

Should the caster be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, parts of his person may be considered exposed, at the DM's option. A dispel magic spell does not remove the spell; the caster can end it upon command."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">By means of this spell, the wizard surrounds himself with an invisible barrier that moves with him. The space within this barrier is totally impervious to all magic and magical spell effects, thus preventing the passage of spells or their effects. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magical items or spells within its confines. The area is also impervious to breath weapons, gaze or voice attacks, and similar special attack forms.<br /><br />The antimagic shell also hedges out charmed, summoned, or conjured creatures. It cannot, however, be forced against any creature that it would keep at bay; any attempt to do so creates a discernible pressure against the barrier, and continued pressure will break the spell. Normal creatures (a normally encountered troll rather than a conjured one, for instance) can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magical sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword. Note that creatures on their home plane are normal creatures there. Thus, on the Elemental Plane of Fire, a randomly encountered fire elemental cannot be kept at bay by this spell. Artifacts, relics, and creatures of demigod or higher status are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.<br /><br />Should the caster be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, parts of his person may be considered exposed, at the DM&#039;s option. A dispel magic spell does not remove the spell; the caster can end it upon command.</div>

Unlike a lightning bolt spell, chain lightning strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to a series of other objects or creatures within range, losing energy with each jump.

The bolt initially inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 12d6 (half damage if the object or creature rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell). After the first strike, the lightning arcs to the next nearest object or creature. Each jump reduces the strength of the lightning by 1d6. Each creature or magical object hit receives a saving throw vs. spell. Success on this save indicates the creature suffers only half damage from the bolt.

The chain can strike as many times (including the first object or creature) as the spellcaster has levels, although each creature or object can be struck only once. Thus, a bolt cast by a 12th-level wizard can strike up to 12 times, causing less damage with each strike. The bolt continues to arc until it has struck the appropriate number of objects or
creatures, until it strikes an object that grounds it (interconnecting iron bars of a large cell or cage, a large pool of liquid, etc.), or until there are no more objects or creatures to strike.

Direction is not a consideration when plotting chain lightning arcs. Distance is a factor- -an arc cannot exceed the spell's range. If the only possible arc is greater than the spell's range, the stroke fades into nothingness. Creatures immune to electrical attack can be struck, even though no damage is taken. Note that it is possible for the chain to arc back to the caster!

Or a contingency could bring a feather fall spell into effect any time the wizard falls more than 2 feet. In all cases, the contingency immediately brings into effect the second spell, the latter being \"cast\" instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. Note that if complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell complex (the contingency spell and the companion magic) may fail when called upon.

The material components of this spell are (in addition to those of the companion spell) 100gp worth of quicksilver and an eyelash of an ogre mage, ki-rin, or similar spell-using creature.

"description":"The control weather spell enables a wizard to change the weather in the local area. The spell affects the weather for 4d6 hours in an area of 4d4 square miles. It requires one turn to cast the spell, and an additional 1d4 turns for the weather conditions to occur. The current weather conditions are decided by the DM, depending on the climate and season.
Weather conditions have three components: precipitation, temperature, and wind. The spell can change these conditions according to the following chart.

The upper-cased headings represent the existing weather conditions. The small headings beneath each large heading are the new conditions to which the caster can change the existing conditions. Furthermore, the caster can control the direction of the wind. For example, a day that is clear and warm with moderate wind can be controlled to become hazy, hot, and calm. Contradictions are not possible--fog and strong wind, for example. Multiple control weather spells can be used only in succession.

The material components for this spell are burning incense and bits of earth and wood mixed in water. Obviously, this spell functions only in areas where there are appropriate climatic conditions."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">The control weather spell enables a wizard to change the weather in the local area. The spell affects the weather for 4d6 hours in an area of 4d4 square miles. It requires one turn to cast the spell, and an additional 1d4 turns for the weather conditions to occur. The current weather conditions are decided by the DM, depending on the climate and season.<br />Weather conditions have three components: precipitation, temperature, and wind. The spell can change these conditions according to the following chart.<br /><br />The upper-cased headings represent the existing weather conditions. The small headings beneath each large heading are the new conditions to which the caster can change the existing conditions. Furthermore, the caster can control the direction of the wind. For example, a day that is clear and warm with moderate wind can be controlled to become hazy, hot, and calm. Contradictions are not possible--fog and strong wind, for example. Multiple control weather spells can be used only in succession.<br /><br />The material components for this spell are burning incense and bits of earth and wood mixed in water. Obviously, this spell functions only in areas where there are appropriate climatic conditions.</div>

The other two ogres and the hill giant are unharmed.

A death spell does not affect lycanthropes, undead creatures, or creatures from planes other than the Prime Material.

"description":"This spell makes a single weapon incredibly sharp by reducing one of its physical dimensions to an infinitesimal measurement. The dimensional blade can slash through matter with as much effort as it takes to wave a stick through the air. Even stone and iron can be carved to pieces with ease. The spell can be cast on almost any hand-held slashing (type S) weapon, as well as a few thrown weapons of this type, such as the chakram, shuriken, or a hand axe.

Against creatures, the dimensional blade ignores any portion of Armor Class derived from armor itself; only magical and Dexterity adjustments affect the opponent's AC. For example, a warrior in chain mail +2 with a Dexterity of 17 is normally AC 20, but against the dimensional blade he only applies the 3-point adjustment for Dexterity and the 2-point magical adjustment, for a total AC of 15. Creatures wearing purely magical armor (such as bracers of defense) may keep the full magical adjustment. Monsters with thick or toughened hides, such as dragons, may lose part of the Armor Class at the DM's discretion. The weapon gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls in any event, but the wielder ignores any Strength-based combat adjustments-muscle power doesn't help the blade at all.

The dimensional blade is also quite effective against inanimate objects. Any object with a diameter or thickness smaller than the blades length must make a saving throw vs. disintegration when struck, or be cleanly severed in twain. Larger objects can be sawed through or sliced away at the rate of about 5 cubic feet per round. It's dangerous to attempt to disarm a dimensional blade; the weapon used must make an item saving throw vs. disintegration or be destroyed.

Finally, the blade is also effective against phased or ethereal creatures since part of its existence is forced into the Ethereal Plane. If the wielder has some way to detect creatures concealed in this way, the blade can strike and affect them normally, but without the power to negate Armor Class or other combat bonuses.

The wizard must touch the weapon to be affected by the spell, but afterward anyone may wield it. The material component for this spell is a razor-thin shard of glass."}</textarea>

"description":"This is a spell that must be used by a wizard planning to create a magical item. The enchant an item spell prepares the object to accept the magic. The item must meet the following tests: 1) it must be in sound and undamaged condition; 2) the item must be the finest possible, considering its nature, i.e., crafted of the highest quality material and with the finest workmanship; and 3) its cost or value must reflect the second test, and in most cases the item must have a raw-materials cost in excess of 100gp. With respect to requirement 3, it is not possible to apply this test to items such as ropes, leather goods, cloth, and pottery not normally embroidered, bejeweled, tooled, carved, or engraved. If such work or materials can be added to an item without weakening or harming its normal functions, however, these are required for the item to be enchanted.

The wizard must have access to a workshop or laboratory, properly equipped and from which contaminating magic can be screened. Any magical item not related to the fabrication process (such as most protective devices) and within 30 feet of the materials is a source of contaminating magic and will spoil the process.

The item to be prepared must be touched by the spellcaster. This touching must be constant and continual during the casting time, which is a base 16 hours plus an additional 8d8 hours (as the wizard may never work more than eight hours per day, and haste or any other spells will not alter the time required in any way, this effectively means that casting time for this spell is two days + 1d8 days). All work must be uninterrupted, and during rest periods the item being enchanted must never be more than 1 foot distant from the spellcaster; if it is, the whole spell is spoiled and must be begun again. (Note that during rest periods absolutely no other form of magic can be performed, and the wizard must remain quiet and in isolation or the enchantment is ruined.)

At the end of the spell, the caster will know that the item is ready for the final test. He will then pronounce the final magical syllable, and if the item makes a saving throw (which is exactly the same as that of the wizard) vs. spell, the spell is completed. The spellcaster's saving throw bonuses also apply to the item, up to +3. A result of 1 on the 1d20 roll always results in failure, regardless of modifications. Once the spell is finished, the wizard can begin to place the desired spell upon the item. The spell he plans to place must be cast within 24 hours or the preparatory spell fades, and the item must be enchanted again.

Each spell subsequently cast upon an object bearing an enchant an item spell requires 2d4 hours per spell level of the magic being cast. Again, during casting the item must be touched by the wizard, and during the rest periods it must always be within 1 foot of his
person. This procedure holds true for any additional spells placed upon the item, and each successive spell must be begun within 24 hours o the last, even if the prior spell failed.

No magic placed on an item is permanent unless a permanency spell is used as a finishing touch. This always runs a 5% risk of draining 1 point of Constitution from the wizard casting the spell. Also, while it is possible to tell when the basic spell (enchant an item) succeeds, it is not possible to tell if successive castings actually work, for each must make the same sort of saving throw as the item itself made. Naturally, an item that is charged--a rod, staff, wand, javelin of lightning, ring of wishes, etc.--can never be made permanent. Magical devices cannot be used to enchant an item or cast magic upon an object so prepared, but scrolls can be used for this purpose.

The materials needed for this spell vary according to both the nature of the item being enchanted and the magic to be cast upon it. For example, a cloak of displacement might require the hides of one or more displacer beasts, a sword meant to slay dragons could require the blood and some other part of the type(s) of dragon(s) it will be effective against, and a ring of shooting stars might require pieces of meteorites and the horn of kirin. These specifics, as well as other information pertaining to this spell, are decided by the DM and must be discovered or researched in play.  "}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">This is a spell that must be used by a wizard planning to create a magical item. The enchant an item spell prepares the object to accept the magic. The item must meet the following tests: 1) it must be in sound and undamaged condition; 2) the item must be the finest possible, considering its nature, i.e., crafted of the highest quality material and with the finest workmanship; and 3) its cost or value must reflect the second test, and in most cases the item must have a raw-materials cost in excess of 100gp. With respect to requirement 3, it is not possible to apply this test to items such as ropes, leather goods, cloth, and pottery not normally embroidered, bejeweled, tooled, carved, or engraved. If such work or materials can be added to an item without weakening or harming its normal functions, however, these are required for the item to be enchanted.<br /><br />The wizard must have access to a workshop or laboratory, properly equipped and from which contaminating magic can be screened. Any magical item not related to the fabrication process (such as most protective devices) and within 30 feet of the materials is a source of contaminating magic and will spoil the process.<br /><br />The item to be prepared must be touched by the spellcaster. This touching must be constant and continual during the casting time, which is a base 16 hours plus an additional 8d8 hours (as the wizard may never work more than eight hours per day, and haste or any other spells will not alter the time required in any way, this effectively means that casting time for this spell is two days + 1d8 days). All work must be uninterrupted, and during rest periods the item being enchanted must never be more than 1 foot distant from the spellcaster; if it is, the whole spell is spoiled and must be begun again. (Note that during rest periods absolutely no other form of magic can be performed, and the wizard must remain quiet and in isolation or the enchantment is ruined.)<br /><br />At the end of the spell, the caster will know that the item is ready for the final test. He will then pronounce the final magical syllable, and if the item makes a saving throw (which is exactly the same as that of the wizard) vs. spell, the spell is completed. The spellcaster&#039;s saving throw bonuses also apply to the item, up to +3. A result of 1 on the 1d20 roll always results in failure, regardless of modifications. Once the spell is finished, the wizard can begin to place the desired spell upon the item. The spell he plans to place must be cast within 24 hours or the preparatory spell fades, and the item must be enchanted again.<br /><br />Each spell subsequently cast upon an object bearing an enchant an item spell requires 2d4 hours per spell level of the magic being cast. Again, during casting the item must be touched by the wizard, and during the rest periods it must always be within 1 foot of his<br />person. This procedure holds true for any additional spells placed upon the item, and each successive spell must be begun within 24 hours o the last, even if the prior spell failed.<br /><br />No magic placed on an item is permanent unless a permanency spell is used as a finishing touch. This always runs a 5% risk of draining 1 point of Constitution from the wizard casting the spell. Also, while it is possible to tell when the basic spell (enchant an item) succeeds, it is not possible to tell if successive castings actually work, for each must make the same sort of saving throw as the item itself made. Naturally, an item that is charged--a rod, staff, wand, javelin of lightning, ring of wishes, etc.--can never be made permanent. Magical devices cannot be used to enchant an item or cast magic upon an object so prepared, but scrolls can be used for this purpose.<br /><br />The materials needed for this spell vary according to both the nature of the item being enchanted and the magic to be cast upon it. For example, a cloak of displacement might require the hides of one or more displacer beasts, a sword meant to slay dragons could require the blood and some other part of the type(s) of dragon(s) it will be effective against, and a ring of shooting stars might require pieces of meteorites and the horn of kirin. These specifics, as well as other information pertaining to this spell, are decided by the DM and must be discovered or researched in play.  </div>

"description":"An eyebite spell enables the caster to merely meet the gaze of a creature and speak a single word to cause an effect. This gaze attack is in addition to any other attacks allowed to the wizard. The wizard selects one of four possible gaze attacks at the time the spell is cast, and this attack cannot be changed. For example, a 12th-level caster who chose fear would have four opportunities to make gaze attacks causing fear, one for each round of the spell's duration. Any gaze attack is negated by a successful saving throw vs. spell, with Wisdom adjustments. The four effects of the spell are as follows:

Charm: The wizard can charm a single person or monster by gaze and by uttering a single word. The effect is to make the charmed subject absolutely loyal and docile to the caster, even to the point of personal danger. It is otherwise the same as a charm monster spell. All creatures other than humans, demihumans, and humanoids save with +2 bonuses.

Fear: The wizard can cause fear by gaze and by speaking a single word. The subject flees in blind terror for 1d4 rounds. After this, the creature refuses to face the caster and cowers or bolts for the nearest cover if subsequently confronted by the caster (50% chance of either). The latter effect lasts one turn per caster level. This attack can be negated by spells that counter fear.

Sicken: This power enables the caster to merely gaze, speak, a word, and cause sudden pain and fever to sweep over the subject's body. Creatures with ability scores function at half effectiveness; others inflict only one-half damage with physical attacks. Movement is at one-half normal rate. The subject remains stricken for one turn per level of the caster, after which all abilities return at the rate of one point per turn of complete rest or one point per hour of moderate activity. The effects cannot be negated by a cure disease or heal spell, but a remove curse or successful dispel magic spell is effective. Creatures other than humans, demihumans, and humanoids save with +2 bonuses versus this attack.

Sleep: The wizard can cause any individual to fall into a comatose slumber by means of a gaze and a single word, unless the subject successfully rolls its saving throw vs. spell. Creatures normally subject to a 1st-level sleep spell save with -2 penalties. An affected creature must be shaken or otherwise shocked back to consciousness.

In all cases, the gaze attack has a speed factor of 1. This spell does not affect undead of any type, or extend beyond the plane occupied by the caster. Note that the caster is subject to the effects of his reflected gaze and is allowed any applicable saving throw. In the case of a reflected charm gaze, the caster is paralyzed until it wears off or is countered."}</textarea>

"description":"A more potent form of the lesser sign of sealing, this spell allows the caster to guard an item or portal and prevent all other creatures from opening or passing through the sealed item or surface. The greater sign has several effects; first of all, it affects a doorway or item that opens (a chest, for instance) as a wizard lock spell. If placed in an open corridor or archway to prevent passage, the greater sign creates a magical barrier that repels all who try to pass.

Second, the greater sign greatly strengthens the physical structure of any door or item it is placed upon, granting a +6 bonus on any item saving throws and allowing the item or door to ignore 1 point of damage per caster level from any attack. For example, a greater sign cast by a 12th-level wizard would reduce the damage of any blow or spell by 12 points, so a fighter armed with a broad sword (maximum damage of 8 points) could never hack through a door protected by the sign.

Finally, if the protected doorway or item is forced open or destroyed by any means, the sign itself is not only destroyed, but also releases a spell upon the offending creature. The spell held by the sign is cast into the ward when the greater sign is created, and any spell the caster has memorized may be used in this way, from a fireball or shocking grasp to a very nasty wish or polymorph. The range of the sign's retributive spell is 10 yards per caster level, so it is possible to destroy the warding from a safe distance.

The sign is displayed in plain sight, and most wizards will recognize it for what it is. The caster cannot specify particular creatures or conditions for the sign’s operation; it functions against any creature that attempts to pass it, although the wizard can freely pass through his own sign without activating it. The greater sign can be removed by the caster, thus ending the spell, or it can be defeated by a limited wish or wish spell cast by a wizard of equal or higher level than the original caster; it cannot be dispelled.

The material component for a greater sign is a powdered diamond worth at least 1,000gp."}</textarea>

5. The whole area radiates magic. The normal use of the detect magic spell becomes impossible for those of less than the caster's level and difficult for others.

"description":"The legend lore spell is used to determine legendary information regarding a known person, place, or thing. If the person or thing is at hand, or if the wizard is in the place in question, the likelihood of the spell producing results is far greater and the casting time is only 1d4 turns. If only detailed information on the person, place, or thing is known, casting time is 1d10 days. If only rumors are known, casting time is 2d6 weeks.

During the casting, the wizard cannot engage in activities other than the routine: eating, sleeping, etc. When completed, the divination reveals if legendary material is available. It often reveals where this material is--by place name, rhyme, or riddle. It sometimes gives certain information regarding the person, place, or thing (when the object of the legend lore is at hand), but this data is always in some cryptic form (rhyme, riddle, anagram, cipher, sign, etc.). Naturally, a legend lore spell reveals information only if the person, place, or thing is noteworthy or legendary.

For example, suppose Delsenora came across an extremely well-made sword. It radiates magic, but when she used an identify spell, she could not learn any information. Even giving it to a trusted fighter didn't work, as the sword did not reveal any special powers. Finally, she casts a legend lore spell, hoping to gain more information. Since the sword is at hand, she completes the spell in three turns. In her mind comes the message, \"Once this was the sword of he who waits till Albion's time of greatest peril, when unto his hand it shall fly again. Fair was the hand that gave me and fair was the hand that reclaimed me.\" Clearly, Delsenora realizes, this must be a very powerful item, since her spell gave only a cryptic answer. But who is he who waits? And where is Albion? For more information, Delsenora is going to have to cast more spells. But now the process will take much longer, since she has only the vaguest of clues to follow.

The legend lore spell is cast with incense and strips of ivory formed into a rectangle, but some item of value to the caster must be sacrificed in addition--a potion, magical scroll, magical item, etc."}</textarea>

Up to one creature per experience level of the caster can be influenced, provided that all subject creatures are within the 30-yard range. Undead are not subject to this spell. The suggestion must be reasonably worded and understood by the creatures, and must be the same for all hearing it. Creatures successfully saving vs. spell are unaffected. Saving throws against the spell suffer a penalty of -1, and if a single creature is to be affected, its saving throw suffers a -4 penalty. Note that a very reasonable mass suggestion can cause the saving throw to be made with an additional penalty (such as -1, -2, etc.), at the discretion of your DM. A mass suggestion can continue in effect for a considerable duration, at the DM&#039;s discretion. Conditions that will trigger a special action can also be specified; if the condition is not met before the spell expires, the action will not be performed.<br /><br />The material components of this spell are a snake&#039;s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil.</div>

"description":"The magic of this spell is similar to that of the vacancy spell, only more powerful and elaborate. The spell enables the caster to make an area appear to be something other than it is - a setting he has personally seen. The spell remains as long as the caster maintains a minimal concentration upon it. Even after this, the spell persists for a total of one hour plus one additional turn for each experience level of the caster. (Note: Minimal concentration can be maintained during normal conversation but not while spellcasting, in melee, or if harmed by an attack.) If the caster actually uses a small bit of anything connected with the place to create this spell, it takes on a quasi reality.

In its basic form, forceful contact is necessary to have any hope of discovering the magic, short of a detection device or spell. In its more complex form, where a material component is used, detection is possible only by some magical means, whether device, item, or spell. Either form of mirage arcana is subject to the dispel magic spell.

As with all powerful illusions, the mind of the believer urges appropriate effects upon the viewer's body. Under the influence of the spell, the viewer could possibly walk across a bed of hot coals thinking it was a shallow stream of water that was cooling his feet (and thus suffer no damage), dine upon imaginary food and actually be satisfied, or rest comfortably upon a bed of sharp stones, thinking it a featherbed. Gravity is not affected by the spell, however, so an envisioned bridge spanning a deep chasm does not support the believer. Those who witness the event see it as a sudden disappearance of the individual. They do not connect it with an illusion unless they are otherwise aware of some magic at work."}</textarea>

"description":"Otiluke's Freezing Sphere is a multipurpose spell of considerable power. If the caster opts, he may create any of the following:

A) Frigid globe. A small globe of matter at absolute zero temperature that spreads upon contact with water, or a liquid that is principally water, freezing it to a depth of 6 inches over an area equal to 100 square feet per level of the spellcaster. This ice lasts for one round per level of the caster.

The material component is a thin sheet of crystal about an inch square.

B) Cold ray. The spell can be used as a thin ray of cold that springs from the caster's hand to a distance of 10 yards per level of the wizard; this ray inflicts 1d4+2 points of damage per level of the caster upon the first creature struck. A saving throw vs. spell is applicable; all damage is negated if it is successful (as the ray is so narrow a save indicates it missed). If the first creature is missed, the path of the ray is plotted to its full distance, and anything else in its path must save (if applicable) or suffer appropriate damage.

The material component is a white sapphire of not less than 1,000gp value.

C) Globe of cold. This creates a small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, but not harmful. This globe can be hurled, either by hand to a distance of 40 yards (considered short range), or as a sling bullet. The globe shatters upon impact, inflicting 6d6 points of cold damage upon all creatures within a 10-foot radius (one-half damage if a saving throw vs. spell is successful). Use the Grenadelike Missile Table in the Dungeon Master Guide to find where misses strike. Note that if the globe is not thrown or slung within one round per level of the spellcaster, it shatters and causes cold damage as stated above. This timed effect can be employed against pursuers, although it can prove hazardous to the spellcaster and his associates as well.

"description":"To prepare for this spell, the caster must build a very hot fire. This can be through making a large fire, or a small fire of materials that burn very hot. The caster must also have an amount of sand on hand. Once the fire has reached the required intensity, the caster imbues a handful of sand with the magic of the spell and tosses it into the flames where they are quickly and brightly incinerated in an instant, and altering the flames to act as a window into the past. 

Any who look upon the flames will see the same event or location as if viewed through a window whose shape flickers with the flame. The caster chooses a location and a time when enchanting the first handful of sand, and can change location and time with each subsequent imbued handful they add to the fire.

The location must be public, something generally accessible to anyone, unless the caster adds to the fire a flammable personal affect of a specific person whose past they wish to view. The item should be relatively whole and personal in nature. Alternatively, a drop of blood or the root of a hair, freshly procured in the last 24 hours, may be used in lieu of a personal item. The location can be changed with a handful of sand. Regardless whether the caster is viewing a public area, or a specific person, a room lined with lead or silver will block the spell and the caster will see nothing but flames.

The time frame is limited to the past, viewed in real time, and limited to increments of exactly 1 year. Should a caster wish to view the events of the previous day, they would have to wait a year minus a day to see them. The time may be changed with a handful of sand to any increment of 1 year that they wish.

Postcognition can be channeled for as long as the caster is no more than 15 from the flames, their intensity is maintained, and the caster maintains concentration on the spell. They may converse with those around them as long as it is about what is happening in the fires. Other conversation is too distracting and will cause the caster to falter. Taking damage requires making a saving throw to maintain concentration.

Because the onlooker sees the events only where flames are, one bigger or closer the flames, the better view the onlooker will have. Frequent users of this spell often have singed hairs and small burns on themselves, as well as a distant and unchanging gaze that feels removed from the world."}</textarea>

"description":"When this spell is cast, the wizard designates one inanimate object of stone, earth, or metal within the spell's range to function as a powerful magnet, attracting all metal. The object affected can be no larger than a 10-feet cube, although a section of wall, floor, or ceiling about 10 square feet will work. Once magnetized, the object exerts a powerful attractive or repulsive force(caster's choice) against objects of ferrous metal. The effects vary by the proximity of the metal objects to the center of magnetism, as shown below .See book for table. 

The movement rate represent how fast objects are drawn to or repelled from the center of magnetism. If the creature or object in question is heavier than the magnetized item, the magnetized item does the moving instead. The effective strength is the pull of the magnetism at that range; the size equivalent refers to creature sizes, not weapons sizes. A character or creature carrying loose metal items or objects such as weapons, shields, helms, buttons, and so on must win opposed strength check  (see player option: combat& tactics for information on opposed ability checks) in order to keep his possessions from being wrenched out of his grasp by the magnetism. Securing a weapon in its sheath, holding an item with both hands, and other precautions may give the character a +2 to +4 to his base ability score, at the DM's discretion.

Characters wearing metal armor must attempt an opposed strength check to ignore the effects of the magnetism. If the character fails his strength check outright, he loses his footing and flies towards or away from the object at the full rate indicated. He suffers full falling damage based on the speed with which he hits the item- 1d6 for every 10 feet of the movement rate, or half that ground if the character passes his strength check but is beaten by the magnetism roll, he is moved one foot for each point he lost by. Again, some precautions or assistance may help iron wearing characters in their strength checks. For monsters, compare the creature's size to the effective size of magnetism.

An armored character who is stuck to a surface or object loses any dexterity adjustments to AC and cannot make any physical attacks. He can try to wriggle out of his armor and free himself, employ a magical item, or use psionic powers if he has any at his disposal.

The material component for this spell is a small bar magnet, bent into a u-shape and coated with mithril."}</textarea>

If the caster is reduced to less than 0 hit points, he is incapacitated and must make a system shock roll or lose all of his highest level spells. The incapacitation lasts only until his regeneration restores him to 1 hit point or more; he can move fight, and cast spells again as soon as his hit point total is positive.

Trollish fortitude does not provide the caster with any defenses against lethal position, disease, and other effects level draining, vampiric touch, or vampiric regeneration cannot be regenerated since this represents damage to the victim's life force and not physical injury. In addition, fire damage and acid damage cannot be regenerated. While the spell is in effect, the caster can rejoin severed limbs simply by holding them in place, but if the spell ends while a limb(which were already moving toward him) is still separate from his body, he immediately suffers the full effects of the injury.

"description":"More insidious and powerful than the feeblemind spell, descent into madness afflicts one creature with a random form of insanity. The spell can affect any creature with an Intelligence of low (5) or higher; however, a character or creature protected by a mind blank is immune to this spell. Creatures are entitled to a normal saving throw vs. spell to withstand the spell. The form of insanity caused by the spell is determined by a roll on the chart: See chart for table.

The various types of insanity and their game effects are described under the Alienist in Chapter 6. The caster has no idea what kind of madness the spell inflicts on its victim, although he may be able to form an educated guess after observing the victim for a few rounds. Descent into madness accelerates the process of insanity radically, producing an advanced condition almost immediately; for example, a character rendered paranoid by this spell skips past suspicion and instantly regards his friends and allies as enemies of the worst sort. The victim has a small chance of recovering with the passage of time (as described under each type of insanity) but other than that the only ways to repair the effects of this spell are restoration, wish, or use of the psionic power psychic surgery.

Note that when turned, the wizard cannot be affected by any form of attack, but when visible, he is subject to double the amount of damage normal for an attack form; for example, a dagger thrust would inflict 2d4 points of damage if it struck a duodimensional wizard.

"description":"This powerful spell enables the caster to bring into being a cube of force, but it is unlike the magical item of that name in one important respect: The forcecage does not have solid walls of force; it has alternating bands of force with ½-inch gaps between. Thus, it is truly a cage, rather than an enclosed space with solid walls. Creatures within the area of effect of the spell are caught and contained unless they are able to pass through the openings--and, of course, all spells and breath weapons can pass through the gaps in the bars of force of the forcecage.

A creature with magic resistance has a single attempt to pass through the walls of the cage. If the resistance check is successful, the creature escapes. If it fails, the creature is caged. Note that a successful check does not destroy the cage, nor does it enable other creatures (save familiars) to flee with the escaping creature. The forcecage is also unlike the solid-walled protective device, cube of force, in that it can be gotten rid of only by means of a dispel magic spell or by the expiration of the spell.

By means of special preparation at the time of memorization, a forcecage spell can be altered to a forcecube spell. The cube created is 10 feet on a side, and the spell then resembles that of a cube of force in all respects save that of the differences between a cast spell and the magic of a device, including the methods of defeating its power.

Although the actual casting of either application of the spell requires no material component, the study required to commit it to memory does demand that the wizard powder a diamond of at least 1,000 gp value, using the diamond dust to trace the outlines of the cage or cube he desires to create via spellcasting at some later time. Thus, in memorization, the diamond dust is employed and expended, for upon completion of study, the wizard must then toss the dust into the air and it will disappear."}</textarea>

It can hide creatures in a 60-yard x 60-yard area: up to 400 man-sized creatures, 30 to 40 giants, or six to eight large dragons. The effect is mobile with the unit and is broken when the unit attacks. Individuals leaving the unit become visible. The wizard can end this spell upon command.<br /><br />The material components of the mass invisibility spell are an eyelash and a bit of gum arabic, the former encased in the latter.</div>

Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the mansion, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.

Once outside, however, its effects disappear immediately, and if those resting have not eaten real food within a reasonable time span, ravenous hunger strikes. Failure to eat normal food immediately results in the onset of fatigue or starvation penalties as decided by the DM.

The material components of this spell are a miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon.

"description":"Related to both the contingency and permanency spells, persistence allows a wizard to cast a spell of 6th level or lower and then hold it until it is needed. There are two general uses for persistence: to use a personal spell effect as needed up to the maximum duration of the persistence itself, or to prepare an instantaneous spell and hold it ready until the caster wishes to use it.

A. Personal effect. Any spell that augments the wizard’s natural abilities - detect magic, protection from evil, jump, infravision, fly, wraithform, or other caster-affecting spells-can be made persistent by use of this spell. The wizard casts persistence and then immediately follows with the desired spell. Instead of taking effect immediately, the magic of the persistence holds it ready for use by a simple act of will. The wizard can then “turn on” or “turn off” the girded spell as often as he likes over the course of the duration of the persistence. The duration of the girded spell only runs while the spell is active, so a 15th-level wizard who makes a fly spell persistent will be able to use 1d6+15 turns of flight (the normal duration of fly) over the next 15 days (the duration of the persistence) as he sees fit.

This is especially useful because it allows the wizard to cast the girded spell and the persistence and have the girded spell’s effects available while he then memorizes another spell in place of the spell made persistent. It is also useful because the girded spell can be activated instantly by an act of will. The main difference between this spell and contingency lies in the fact that a persistent spell may be invoked several times (up to the limit of its normal duration) while a contingency functions once only.

B. Held spell. Spells that have an instantaneous effect, such as most attack spells and some movement spells like teleport or dimension door, can be rendered persistent as well. The held spell may be activated or discharged at any time during the duration of the persistence, but its magic is then exhausted as if it had been cast normally. This resembles the effect of a contingency spell, but the effect has no predefined conditions and simply occurs when the caster wills it to.

Damaging or offensive spells that have a duration (for example, flaming sphere or wall of fire) cannot be rendered persistent. A wizard may have no more than one persistence spell active at any given time; if he girds a new spell while an old one is still persistent, the old spell is simply replaced by the new one. The material component is a crystal chalice of exquisite workmanship worth at least 2,000 gp. The material component of a held or girded spell is expended when the spell is made persistent."}</textarea>

Thus, a sequester spell can mask a secret door, a treasure vault, etc. Of course, the spell does not prevent the subject from being discovered through tactile means or through the use of devices (such as a robe of eyes or a gem of seeing). If cast upon a creature who is unwilling to be affected, the creature receives a normal saving throw. Living creatures (and even undead types) affected by a sequester spell become comatose and are effectively in a state of suspended animation until the spell wears off or is dispelled.<br /><br />The material components of the spell are a basilisk eyelash, gum arabic, and a dram of whitewash.</div>

"description":"In order to use the shadow walk spell, the wizard must be in an area of heavy shadows. The caster and any creature he touches are then transported to the edge of the Prime Material Plane where it borders the Demiplane of Shadow. In this region, the wizard can move at a rate of up to 7 miles per turn, moving normally on the borders of the Demiplane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Prime Material Plane. Thus, a wizard can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Demiplane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Prime Material Plane. The wizard knows where he will come out on the Prime Material Plane.

The shadow walk spell can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Demiplane of Shadow, but this requires the potentially perilous transit of the Demiplane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality.

Any creatures touched by the wizard when shadow walk is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Demiplane of Shadow. They may opt to follow the wizard, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Prime Material Plane (50% chance for either result if they are lost or abandoned by the wizard). Creatures unwilling to accompany the wizard into the Demiplane of Shadow receive a saving throw, negating the effect if successful."}</textarea>

"description":"  This spell allows the wizard to set certain vibrations to emanate from an object or location that tend to either repel or attract a specific type of intelligent creature or characters of a particular alignment. The wizard must decide which effect is desired with regard to what creature type or alignment before beginning the spellcasting, for the components of each application differ. The spell cannot be cast upon living creatures.
  Antipathy: This spell causes the affected creature or alignment type to feel an overpowering urge to leave the area or to not touch the affected item. If a saving throw vs. spell is successful, the creature can stay in the area or touch the item, but the creature will feel very uncomfortable, and a persistent itching will cause it to suffer the loss of 1
point of Dexterity per round (for the spell's duration), subject to a maximum loss of 4 points and a minimum Dexterity of 3. Failure to save vs. spell forces the being to abandon the area or item, shunning it permanently and never willingly returning to it until the spell is removed or expires.
  The material component for this application of the spell is a lump of alum soaked in vinegar.
  Sympathy: By casting the sympathy application of the spell, the wizard can cause a particular type of creature or alignment of character to feel elated and pleased to be in an area or touching or possessing an object or item. The desire to stay in the area or touch the object is overpowering. Unless a saving throw vs. spell is successfully rolled, the creature or character will stay or refuse to release the object. If the saving throw is successful, the creature or character is released from the enchantment, but a subsequent saving throw must be made 1d6 turns later. If this saving throw fails, the affected creature will return to the area or object.
  The material components of this spell are 1,000 gp worth of crushed pearls and a drop
of honey.
  Note that the particular type of creature to be affected must be named specifically--for example, red dragons, hill giants, wererats, lammasu, catoblepas, vampires, etc. Likewise, the specific alignment must be named--for example, chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful neutral, true neutral, etc.
  If this spell is cast upon an area, a 10-foot cube can be enchanted for each experience level of the caster. If an object or item is enchanted, only that single thing can be enchanted; affected creatures or characters save vs. spell with a -2 penalty. "}</textarea>

If this saving throw fails, the affected creature will return to the area or object.<br />  The material components of this spell are 1,000 gp worth of crushed pearls and a drop<br />of honey.<br />  Note that the particular type of creature to be affected must be named specifically--for example, red dragons, hill giants, wererats, lammasu, catoblepas, vampires, etc. Likewise, the specific alignment must be named--for example, chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful neutral, true neutral, etc.<br />  If this spell is cast upon an area, a 10-foot cube can be enchanted for each experience level of the caster. If an object or item is enchanted, only that single thing can be enchanted; affected creatures or characters save vs. spell with a -2 penalty. </div>

"description":"  A binding spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature, usually from another plane of existence. Extraplanar creatures must be confined by a circular diagram; other creatures can be physically confined. The duration of the spell depends upon the form of the binding and the level of the caster(s), as well as the length of time the spell is actually
uttered. The components vary according to the form of the spell, but they include a continuous chanting utterance read from the scroll or book page giving the spell; gestures appropriate to the form of binding; and materials such as miniature chains of special metal (silver for lycanthropes, etc.), soporific herbs of the rarest sort, a corundum or diamond gem of great size (1,000 gp value per Hit Die of the subject creature), and a vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be captured.
  Magic resistance applies unless the subject's true name is used. A saving throw is not applicable as long as the experience level of the caster is at least twice as great as the Hit Dice of the subject. The caster's level can be augmented by one-third of the levels of each assisting wizard of 9th level or higher, and by one level for each assistant of 4th through 8th level. No more than six other wizards can assist with this spell. If the caster's level is less than twice the Hit Dice of the subject, the subject gains a saving throw vs. spell, modified by the form of binding being attempted. The various forms of binding are:
  Chaining: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except the caster. Duration is as long as one year per level of the caster(s). The subject of this form of binding (as well as in the slumber and bound slumber versions) remains within the restraining barrier.
  Slumber: Brings a comatose sleep upon the subject for a duration of up to one year per level of the caster(s).
  Bound Slumber: A combination of chaining and slumber that lasts for up to one month per level of the caster(s).
  Hedged Prison: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means until freed. The spell remains until the magical hedge is somehow broken.
  Metamorphosis: Causes the subject to change to some noncorporeal form, save for its head or face. The binding is permanent until some prescribed act frees the subject.
 Minimus Containment: The subject is shrunken to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within the hedged prison of some gem or similar object. The subject of a minimus containment, metamorphosis, or hedged prison radiates a very faint aura of magic. 
  The subject of the chaining form of the spell receives a saving throw with no modifications. However, slumber allows the subject a +1 bonus, bound slumber a +2 bonus, hedged prison a +3 bonus, metamorphosis a +4 bonus, and minimus containment a +5 bonus to the saving throw. If the subject is magically weakened, the DM can assign a -1, -2, or even -4 penalty to the saving throw. A successful saving throw enables the subject to burst its bonds and do as it pleases.
  A binding spell can be renewed in the case of the first three forms of the spell, for the subject does not have the opportunity to break the bonds. (If anything has caused a weakening of a chaining or slumber version, such as attempts to contact the subject or magically touch it, a normal saving throw applies to the renewal of the spell.) Otherwise, after one year, and each year thereafter, the subject gains a normal saving throw vs. the spell. Whenever it is successful, the binding spell is broken and the creature is free."}</textarea>

"description":"  This powerful spell allows a caster to transfer a large area of land in the Prime Material plane to any of the elemental planes. All buildings, people, and wildlife within the area of effect are also transported. The land forms a pocket of the Prime Material plane within the elemental plane. The pocket is a sphere with a diameter equal to the diameter of the land. The surface of the pocket allows creatures to enter or exit the pocket, but prevents the elements from entering the pocket.
  Inside the pocket, the land is surrounded by air of a temperature matching that of the Prime Material plane at the moment the land was moved. In addition, a source of water is created within the pocket.
  Before the spell is cast, the area to be moved must be surrounded by solid markers of material from the destination plane.Thus,if a wizard wants to move his castle to the Elemental plane of Fire,he must first surround the area with solid blocks of matter from the elemental plane of Fire; such as hardened magma or magically crystallized fire.The blocks must be spaced no more than five feet apart and may be placed above ground or under surface(at a depth of no more than three fee).
  The wizard must be within the area to be moved when he casts the spell. When the land moves, a hemispherical crater is left behind in the Prime Material plane. Inside its pocket on the desired plane, the land continues its existence as if
nothing changed, with the exception of occasional visits from planar creatures.
  Any land that is moved in this manner can never again be moved with this spell.
  The material component (in addition to the markers) is the appropriate magical device to control elementals of the desired plane (bowl commanding water elementals, brazier commanding fire elementals, censer controlling air elementals, or stone controlling earth elementals). The item must be permanently placed at the heart of the area of effect and cannot be used for any other purpose. If the device is disturbed in any way, the spell immediately fails, allowing the energies of the elemental plane to flood into the protected area."}</textarea>

Each casting of Greater Permanency reduces the wizard's constitution by 1 point. 

The personal spells upon which a permanency is known to be effective are as follows: comprehend languages, detect evil, detect invisibility, detect magic, infravision, protection from cantrips, protection from evil, protection from normal missiles, read magic, tongues, unseen servant. These spells may not be made permanent upon other creatures.

In addition to personal use, the permanency spell can be used to make the following object/creature or area-effect spells permanent: enlarge, fear, gust of wind, invisibility, magic mouth, prismatic sphere, stinking cloud, wall of fire, wall of force, web.

Additionally, the following spells can be cast upon objects or areas only and be rendered permanent: alarm, audible glamer, dancing lights, solid fog, wall of fire, distance distortion, teleport.

These applications to other spells allow it to be cast simultaneously with any of the latter when no living creature is the target, but the entire spell complex then can be dispelled normally, and thus negated. At the DM's option, permanency might become unstable or fail after a long period of at least 1,000 years. Unstable effects might operate intermittently or fail altogether.

The DM may allow other selected spells to be made permanent. Researching this possible application of a spell costs as much time and money as independently researching the selected spell. If the DM has already determined that the application is not possible, the research automatically fails. Note that the wizard never learns what is possible except by the success or failure of his research."}</textarea>

"description":"  This potent spell exchanges the necromancer's own living heart for a finely crafted heart of perfect,unblemished stone that alters the very nature of the wizard's body.As long as the heart of stone remains in effect,the caster need not fear attacks that pierce,slash,or cut him;he does not bleed and can ignore the most horrible injuries of this kind.The caster can also ignore most magical effects such as spell,magical devices,and innate spell abilities of less than 8th level.
   In game terms,the character suffers only 1 point of damage from any type S or type P attack,plus any magical adjustment for the weapon.For example,if struck by a long sword +1,he would suffer only 2 points of damage.Strength and specialization bonuses are ignored.If the wizard is dismembered,he suffers no additional damage other than the inconvenience of having his limbs removed,and he can reattach a severed limb by holding it in place for one full turn.The heart of stone is also partially effective against type B attacks since it prevents bruising,swelling,and crushed blood vessels.Against bludgeoning weapons,the wizard only suffers half the normal damage.Cause wound spell always inflict minimum damage against a wizard protected by this spell.While the caster may not feel a sword in his rib cage,any damage sustained interrupts spellcasting.
    In addition to resisting injury,the heart of stone also renders the character immune to fatigue and exhaustion,whether normal or magical.He also gains a +4 bonus to saving throws vs,petrification attacks.
   While the heart of stone is quite powerful,it has limitations.First of all,determined physical attack can eventually destroy the wizard despite his unnatural resistance to injury-a mob of angry peasants with hatchets and spears can finish him off 1 point at a time if that's what it takes.
Second,the heart confers no protection against other attack forms,such as fire,electricity,cold,acid,and so on,although any bleeding caused by a burn is ignored.Disintegration effects also affect the caster.Most importantly,the caster loses the ability to naturally recover from injury and no longer regains lost hit points with the passage of time.Healing spells,potions and items are reduced to their minimum effect,so a cure serious wounds (2d8+1 hit points restored)would only return 3 hit points to a wizard protected by heart of stone.However,limited wish or wish can be used to restore 1 hit point per level of caster or all but 1d4 hit points,respectively.
  In addition to these disadvantages,heart of stone also renders the caster vulnerable in one other way;his own real heart can be destroyed,instantly slaying him.Naturally,the caster will want to take steps to hide and protect his true heart to prevent this happening.The living heart continues to beat for the duration of the spell but requires no special receptacle or facilities to protect it-the caster could leave it lying on the floor,if he wished.
     The heart of stone cannot be dispelled,although a more powerful negation magic such as Mordenkainen's disjunction can bring the spell to an end.Stone to flesh also undoes the magic of the heart of stone.No matter how the spell is ended,the wizard's own living heart instantly returns to its proper place,and the stone heart appears wherever the living heart was kept.At this time,any injuries the wizard currently has are multiplied by 1d6 as the wounds begin to bleed again.For example,a necromancer who was injured for 6 points of damage instead suffers 6d6 when the spell ends.
      The material component for this spell is the stone heart itself.This must be a carved stone of quality (jade,obsidian,or gold-veined marble would be appropriate)worth not less than 5,000 gold pieces.It must be prepared by use of the enchant an item spell.The stone is not consumed at the spell's end and may be used again if it is undamaged.

Spells or attacks that affect the subject's physiology or respiration-for example, poison, cloud kill, enfeeblement, contagion or vain touch-fail completely, since the caster has no physiology or respiration while the spell is in effect. Also, spells that have weight limits should be applied to the wizard as if he weighed over 3000 pounds. The wizard ignores electrical attacks and saves at +4 against fire attacks. If he saves, he takes quarter damage;if not, he takes half damage. If hit with a rod of smiting, he takes 2d8+6 points of damage unless the attacker rolls a natural 20.If this occurs, then the damage is doubled.
  In addition to the natural immunities of an iron body, the wizard enjoys powerful offensive abilities. His strength score is raised to 20 for the duration of the spell, and he can punch or bludgeon his enemies twice per round for 1d4 points of damage per blow, plus his strength bonus. Unfortunately,his movement becomes slow and awkward, so he is reduced to a move of 3 and suffers a -2 penalty to his initiative rolls.Most importantly, the wizard's clumsiness and lack of breath prevent him from casting any spells while the iron body is in effect.
  Iron body may create additional hazards for the wizard as the DM deems appropriate. For example,rust monsters are extremely dangerous to a wizard using this spell.Heat metal spells inflict double damage to the caster, And, naturally, the wizard sinks like a stone in water-although he could survive the crushing pressure and lack of air at the bottom of the ocean-at least until the spell expired.Some magical items, such as potions or winded instruments, may be temporarily unusable as well.
  The material component for this spell is a small piece of iron that once belonged to an iron golem.

"description":"  This spell changes one object or creature into another. When used as a polymorph other or stone to flesh spell, simply treat the spell as a more powerful version, with saving throws made with -4 penalties to the die roll. When it is cast in order to change other objects, the duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its enchanted state, as well as how different it is in size. The DM determines the changes by using the following guidelines:See book for table.
  A change in kingdom makes the spell work for hours (if removed by one kingdom) or turns (if removed by two). Other changes likewise affect spell duration. Thus, changing a lion to an androsphinx would be permanent, but turning a turnip to a purple worm would be a change with a duration measured in hours. Turning a tusk into an elephant would be
permanent, but turning a twig into a sword would be a change with a duration of several turns.
  All polymorphed objects radiate a strong magic, and if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon them, they return to their natural form. Note that a stone to flesh spell or its reverse will affect objects under this spell. As with other polymorph spells, damage sustained in the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed
creature.
  For example, it is possible to polymorph a creature into rock and grind it to dust, causing damage, perhaps even death. If the creature was changed to dust to start with, more creative methods to damage it would be needed; perhaps the wizard could use a gust of wind spell to scatter the dust far and wide. In general, damage occurs when the
new form is altered through physical force, although the DM will have to adjudicate many of these situations.
  The system shock roll must be applied to living creatures, as must the restrictions noted regarding the polymorph other and stone to flesh spells. Also note that a polymorph effect often detracts from an item's or creature's powers, but does not add new powers, except possibly movement capabilities not present in the old form. Thus, a vorpal sword polymorphed into a dagger would not retain vorpal capability. Likewise, valueless items cannot be made into permanent valuable items.

"description":"  This spell combines several elements to create a powerful protection from scrying and direct observation. When the spell is cast, the wizard dictates what will and will not be observed in the area of effect. The illusion created must be stated in general terms. Thus, the caster could specify the illusion of him and another playing chess for the duration of the spell, but he could not have the illusionary chess players take a break, make dinner,and then resume their game. He could have a crossroads appear quiet and empty even while an army is actually passing through the area. He could specify that no one be seen (including passing strangers), that his troops be undetected, or even that every fifth man or unit should be visible. Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed.
  Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by the caster with no saving throw allowed. Sight and sound are appropriate to the illusion created. A band of men standing in a meadow could be concealed as an empty meadow with birds chirping, etc. Direct observation may allow a saving throw (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Certainly onlookers in the area would become suspicious if the column of a marching army disappeared at one point to reappear at another! Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a saving throw, assuming the hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion."}</textarea>

When the spell is cast, the wizard dictates what will and will not be observed in the area of effect. The illusion created must be stated in general terms. Thus, the caster could specify the illusion of him and another playing chess for the duration of the spell, but he could not have the illusionary chess players take a break, make dinner,and then resume their game. He could have a crossroads appear quiet and empty even while an army is actually passing through the area. He could specify that no one be seen (including passing strangers), that his troops be undetected, or even that every fifth man or unit should be visible. Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed.<br />  Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by the caster with no saving throw allowed. Sight and sound are appropriate to the illusion created. A band of men standing in a meadow could be concealed as an empty meadow with birds chirping, etc. Direct observation may allow a saving throw (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Certainly onlookers in the area would become suspicious if the column of a marching army disappeared at one point to reappear at another! Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a saving throw, assuming the hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion.</div>

"description":"  By means of the astral spell, a wizard can project his astral body into the Astral Plane, leaving his physical body and material possessions behind in the Prime Material Plane. Only magical items can be brought into the Astral Plane (although nonmagical items could be rendered temporarily magical through the use of some spells, if the DM allows).
As the Astral Plane touches upon the first levels of all of the Outer Planes, the wizard can travel astrally to any of the Outer Planes at will. The caster then leaves the Astral Plane, forming a body in the plane of existence he has chosen to enter. It is also possible to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime Material Plane by means of the astral spell, but a second body cannot be formed in the Prime Material Plane. As a general rule, a person astrally projected can be seen only by creatures in the Astral Plane.
   At all times, the astral body is connected to the material body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the affected person is killed, astrally and materially; however, normally only a psychic wind can cause the cord to break. When a second body is formed in a different plane, the silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to the original body where it rests in the Prime Material Plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation.
   Although astrally projected persons are able to function in the Astral Plane, their actions do not affect creatures not existing in the Astral Plane. The spell lasts until the wizard desires to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means (such as a dispel magic spell or the destruction of the wizard's body in the Prime Material Plane).
   The wizard can project the astral forms of up to seven other creatures with him by means of the astral spell, providing the creatures are linked in a circle with the wizard. These fellow travelers are dependent upon the wizard and can be stranded. Travel in the Astral Plane can be slow or fast, according to the wizard's desire. The ultimate
destination arrived at is subject to the conceptualization of the wizard. (See the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set for further information on the Astral Plane.)
  Any magical items can go into the Astral Plane, but most become temporarily nonmagical therein, or in any planes removed from the Prime Material Plane. Armor and weapons of +3 or better might function in other planes, at the DM's option. Artifacts and relics function anywhere. Items drawing their power from a given plane are more powerful in that plane (for example, a ring of fire resistance in the Elemental Plane of Fire or a sword of life stealing in the Negative Energy plane)."}</textarea>

  Chain contingency allows the caster to designate either two or three spells that will take effect automatically under a specific set of conditions.In other words, when a set of conditions is met, the designated spells are cast immediately without the caster's intervention.
  Chain contingency must be cast together with the spells it is to trigger.The caster may choose either two spells to occur simultaneously or three spells to occur consecutively, one per round.Spells must be of 8th level or lower. Only the 6th level contingency spell may not be included.The casting time of 2 turns includes the casting of the spells to be triggered.
  Unlike the contingency spell,spells 'stored' in chain contingency can affect creatures other than the caster.These instructions must be carefully worded;the spell obeys the letter of its instructions and not the caster's intentions. 
  In casting chain contingency, the wizard defines the conditions that will trigger the stored spells. This definition must be carefully worded but may be as limiting or general as the caster desires.The caster also states the exact order, target, range, and manner in which the stored spells are to be cast.
  The spell has several limitations in triggering its spells.It does not have any powers of discernment;thus,an instruction to target the highest level enemy is not possible.Furthermore, the conditions cannot involve a delay;a spell cannot be ordered to trigger three turns after 1 sneeze.
 When the named conditions are met,the chain contingency is automatically triggered. If all specifics of casting a spell are not specified.(e.g., target or area of effect),the effect is automatically centered on the caster.
 Possible triggers might include a fall from a distance greater than the caster's height,the appearance of the first beholder within 30 feet of the caster or the wizard pointing his finger and pronouncing a specified word.
  The material components are (in addition to those of the companion spells) 500 gp worth of quicksilver; a gem of at least 1000 gp value;a spell using creature and an ivory statuette of the wizard (which is not destroyed in the casting of the spell)which must be carried by the spellcaster in order for the chain contingency to perform its function when triggered."}</textarea>

"description":"  The magic of this spell causes metal, whether as soft as gold or as hard as adamantite, to turn to a crystalline substance as brittle and fragile as crystal. Thus, a sword, metal shield, metal armor, or even an iron golem can be changed to a delicate, glasslike material easily shattered by any forceful blow. Furthermore, this change is unalterable by any means short of a wish spell; a dispel magic will not reverse the spell.
  The caster must physically touch the item; if it is an opponent or something an opponent is using or wearing, the wizard must get into melee and make a successful attack roll. Any single metal item can be affected by the spell. Thus, a suit of armor worn by a creature can be changed to crystal, but the creature's shield would not be affected,
and vice versa. All items gain a saving throw equal to their magical bonus value or protection (the DM has this information). A +1/+3 sword would get a 10% (average of the two pluses) chance to save; +5 magical armor has a 25% chance to be unaffected; an iron golem has a 15% chance to save (for it is hit only by magical weapons of +3 or
better quality). Artifacts and relics constructed of metal may be affected at the discretion of the DM, though it is highly unlikely. Affected items not immediately protected are shattered and permanently destroyed if struck by a normal blow from a metal tool or any weighty weapon, including a staff."}</textarea>

range. Any creature in the straight-line path of these missiles receives the full effect, without benefit of a saving throw. The meteor missiles leave a fiery trail of sparks, and each bursts as a fireball.
  The large spheres (2-foot diameter) inflict 10d4 points of damage, bursting in a diamond or box pattern. Each has a 30-foot diameter area of effect, and each sphere is 20 feet apart along the sides of the pattern, creating overlapping areas of effect and exposing the center to all four blasts.
  The smaller spheres (1-foot diameter) each have a 15-foot diameter area of effect, and each inflicts 5d4 points of damage. They burst in a pattern of a box within a diamond or vice versa, with each of the outer sides 20 feet long. Note that the center has four areas of overlapping effect, and there are numerous peripheral areas that have two overlapping areas of effect. A saving throw for each area of effect will indicate whether full damage or half damage is sustained by creatures within each area, except as already stated with regard to the missiles impacting."}</textarea>

"description":"  When this spell is cast, all magic and magical items within the radius of the spell, except those on the person of or being touched by the spellcaster, are disjoined.

successfully save (vs. spell if actually cast on a creature, or vs. a dispel magic spell otherwise) or be turned into normal items. Even artifacts and relics are subject to Mordenkainen's disjunction, though there is only a 1% chance per caster experience level of actually affecting such powerful items. Thus, all potions, scrolls, rings, rods, miscellaneous magical items, artifacts and relics, arms and armor, swords, and miscellaneous weapons within 30 feet of the spellcaster can possibly lose all their magical properties when the Mordenkainen's disjunction spell is cast. The caster also has a 1% chance per level of destroying an antimagic shell. If the shell survives the disjunction, no items within it are disjoined.
  Note: Destroying artifacts is a dangerous business, and 95% likely to attract the attention of some powerful being who has an interest or connection with the device. Additionally, if an artifact is destroyed, the casting wizard must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell with a -4 penalty or permanently lose all spellcasting abilities."}</textarea>

"description":"With this spell, a wizard is able to assume the form of any living thing or creature below demigod status (greater or lesser deity, singular dragon type, or the like). The spellcaster becomes the creature he wishes, and has all of its abilities save those dependent upon Intelligence, innate magical abilities, and magic resistance, for the mind of the creature is that of the spellcaster. Thus, he can change into a griffon and fly away, then to an efreet and fly through a roaring flame, then to a titan to lift up a wagon, etc. These creatures have whatever hit points the wizard had at the time of the shape change. Each alteration in form requires only a second, and no system shock is incurred.
For example, a wizard is in combat and assumes the form of a will o' wisp. When this form is no longer useful, the wizard changes into a stone golem and walks away. When pursued, the golem-shape is changed to that of a flea, which hides on a horse until it can hop off and become a bush. If detected as the latter, the wizard can become a dragon, an ant, or just about anything he is familiar with.
A wizard adopting another form also adopts its vulnerabilities. For example, a wizard who becomes a spectre is powerless in daylight, and is subject to being turned, controlled, or destroyed by opposing clerics. Unlike similar spells, a wizard who is killed in another form does not revert to his original shape, which may disallow certain types of revivification.
The material component is a jade circlet worth no less than 5,000 gp, which shatters at the end of the spell's duration. In the meantime, the circlet is left in the wake of the shape change, and premature shattering ends the spell immediately."}</textarea>

"description":" Upon casting a time stop spell, the wizard causes the flow of time to stop for one round in the area of effect. Outside this area the sphere simply seems to shimmer for an instant. Inside the sphere, the caster is free to act for 1d3 rounds of apparent time. The wizard can move and act freely within the area where time is stopped, but all other creatures, except for those of demigod and greater status or unique creatures, are frozen in their actions, for they are literally between ticks of the time clock. (The spell duration is subjective to the caster.) Nothing can enter the area of effect without being stopped in time also. If the wizard leaves the area, the spell is immediately negated. When the spell duration ceases, the wizard is again operating in normal time.
  Note: It is recommended that the DM use a stopwatch or silently count to time this spell. If the caster is unable to complete the intended action before the spell duration expires, he will probably be caught in an embarrassing situation. The use of a teleport spell before the expiration of the time stop spell is permissible."}</textarea>

"description":" This spell confronts those affected by it with phantasmal images of their most feared enemies, forcing an imaginary combat that seems real, but actually occurs in the blink of an eye. When this spell is cast, the wizard must be able to converse with the victims to bring the spell into being. During the casting, the wizard must call out to the creatures to be affected, informing one or all that their final fate, indeed their doom, is now upon them.
 The force of the magic is such that even if the creatures make their saving throws vs. spell, fear will paralyze them for a full round, and they will lose 1d4 Strength points from this fear (the lost Strength will return in one turn). Failure to save vs. spell causes the creature or creatures to face their nemeses, the opponents most feared and inimical to them. Actual combat must then take place, for no magical means of escape is possible. The foe fought is real for all intents and purposes; affected creatures that lose will die. If a creature's phantasmal nemesis from the weird spell is slain, the creature emerges with no damage, no loss of items seemingly used in the combat, and no loss of spells likewise seemingly expended. The creature also gains any experience for defeating the weird, if applicable.
 Although each round of combat seems normal, it takes only one-tenth of a round. During the course of the spell, the caster must concentrate fully upon maintaining it. If the combat goes beyond 10 rounds, those who saved against the spell can take action. If the caster is disturbed, the weird spell ends immediately. Creatures attacked while paralyzed with fear are free of the paralysis immediately."}</textarea>
