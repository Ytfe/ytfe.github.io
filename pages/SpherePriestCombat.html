"description":"The recipient of this spell gains the benefit of a bless spell (+1 to attack rolls and saving throws) and a special bonus of 1d8 additional hit points for the duration of the spell. The aid spell enables the recipient to actually have more hit points than his full normal total. The bonus hit points are lost first when the recipient takes damage; they cannot be regained by curative magic.
For example, a 1st-level fighter has 8 hit points, suffers 2 points of damage (8-2 = 6), and then receives an aid spell that gives 5 additional hit points. The fighter now has 11 hit points, 5 of which are temporary. If he is then hit for 7 points of damage, 2 normal hit points and all 5 temporary hit points are lost. He then receives a cure light wounds spell that heals 4 points of damage, restoring him to his original 8 hit points.
Note that the operation of the spell is unaffected by permanent hit point losses due to energy drain, Hit Die losses, the loss of a familiar, or the operation of certain artifacts; the temporary hit point gain is figured from the new, lower total.
The material components of this spell are a tiny strip of white cloth with a sticky substance (such as tree sap) on the ends, plus the priest's holy symbol."}</textarea>

"description":"By calling upon his deity, the caster of a spiritual hammer spell brings into existence a field of force shaped vaguely like a hammer. As long as the caster concentrates upon the hammer, it strikes at any opponent within its range, as desired. Each round the caster can choose to attack the same target as the previous round or switch to a new target that he can see anywhere within his maximum range. The spiritual hammer's chance to successfully hit is equal to that of the caster, without any Strength bonuses. In addition, it strikes as a magical weapon with a bonus of +1 for every six experience levels (or fraction) of the spellcaster, up to a total of +3 to the attack roll and +3 to the damage roll for a 13th-level caster. The base damage inflicted when it scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal war hammer (1d4+1 points on opponents of man size or smaller, or 1d4 points on larger opponents, plus the magical bonus). The hammer strikes in the same direction as the caster is facing, so if he is behind the target, all bonuses for rear attack are gained along with the loss of any modifications to the target's AC for shield and Dexterity.
As soon as the caster ceases concentration, the spiritual hammer spell ends. A dispel magic spell that includes either the caster or the force in its area of effect has a chance to dispel the spiritual hammer. If an attacked creature has magic resistance, the resistance is checked the first time the spiritual hammer strikes. If the hammer is successfully resisted, the spell is lost. If not, the hammer has its normal full effect for the duration of the spell.
The material component of this spell is a normal war hammer that the priest must hurl toward opponents while uttering a plea to his deity. The hammer disappears when the spell is cast."}</textarea>

"description":"This cooperative spell requires at least three priests casting the spell simultaneously.
At the time of casting, the priests must be within 10 feet of each other. Upon completion of the spell, the priests sing a single, dissonant chord. The result of the spell depends on the number of voices in the choir.
Trio. In this form, the spell projects a cone of sonic force 120 feet long and 40 feet wide at the base. All creatures within the area of effect must save vs. spells or suffer 2d4 points of damage. Those who successfully save suffer only 1d4 points. Undead suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throws.
Quartet. With four voices, the spell has the same area of effect as described above.
However, all those who fail their saving throw suffer 2d4 points of damage and are deafened for one round. Those who successfully save suffer half damage and are not deafened. Undead creatures are not allowed a saving throw.
Quintet. Five singers produce a chord of major power. All within the area of effect suffer 3d4 points of damage (saving throw for half damage). Undead are not allowed a saving throw. All creatures are deafened for one round. Furthermore, pottery, glassware, crystal, and similar breakable goods must save vs. fall or be shattered.
Ensemble. An ensemble of singers consists of six to ten priests. In this case, the area of effect increases to a cone 180 feet long and 60 feet wide at the base. All creatures within this area suffer 1d4 points of damage per priest and are deafened for 1d4 rounds.
A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces the damage and duration of deafness by half.
Undead creatures of 3 hit dice or less are immediately destroyed. All other undead suffer normal damage, but are not allowed a saving throw. Glass, pottery, crystal, bone, and all wooden items that are the strength of a door or less (chests, tables, chairs, etc.) must save vs. crushing blow or be shattered.
Choir. The most powerful group, a choir, requires eleven or more priests. In this case, the area of effect expands to a cone 300 feet long and 100 feet wide at the base. All within the area of effect suffer 1d6 points of damage per priest to a maximum of 20d6. A saving throw vs. spells reduces the damage to half. Those who fail to save are deafened for 1d10 rounds; those who succeed are deafened only 1d6 rounds. Undead creatures of 5 hit dice or less are immediately destroyed. Undead with more hit dice are not allowed a saving throw. Structures within the area of effect are damaged as if they suffered a direct hit from a catapult (one hit per four priests in the choir). Doors, chests, and other breakable items are instantly shattered."}</textarea>

It drives off evil creatures from other planes, forcing them to return to their own planes of existence, provided the speaker is in his home plane. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least a day. The spell further affects creatures of differing alignment as shown on the following table: Effects of Holy Word Creature&#039;s Hit Dice or Attack Level General Move Dice Spells Less than 4 Kills -- -- -- 4 to 7+ Paralyzes 1d4 turns -- -- -- 8 to 11+ Slows 2d4 rounds -50% -4* -- 12 or more Deafens 1d4 rounds -25% -2 50% chance of failure * Slowed creatures attack only on even-numbered rounds until the effect wears off.<br />Affected creatures are those within the 30-foot-radius area of effect, which is centered on the priest casting the spell. The side effects are negated for deafened or silenced creatures, but such are still driven off if other-planar.<br />The reverse, unholy word, operates exactly the same way but affects creatures of good alignment.</div>

"description":"By use of this spectacular spell, the priest rearranges the extradimensional and spatial geometries of the molecules of one or more creatures. The result is that the rearrangement of the target creature causes it to implode (collapse inward upon itself) or invert (its insides become its outsides and vice versa).
The result is usually inversion, unless the target would not be adversely affected by this process (e.g., a slime, ooze, golem, elemental, etc.). In this case, implosion takes place. In either case, the effect kills/destroys the target instantaneously unless it makes a successful saving throw versus death magic at a -4 penalty.
The priest can affect one creature per round with this spell. After each round, the priest must make a Constitution check. If this fails, the priest is overwhelmed with the effort of sustaining the spell, at which time the spell terminates, leaving the priest fatigued (the equivalent of being stunned) for 1d4 rounds. The maximum possible duration of the spell is 3 turns."}</textarea>
