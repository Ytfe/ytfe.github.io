"description":"A necromancer must touch a willing subject in the casting of this spell, turning their muscles into undead muscles, raising their strength temporarily.

The subject of the spell makes an exchange of HP for Strength. For every HP they lose, they temporarily gain 1 point of strength, to a maximum of 18/100 (each category of exceptional strength counts as 1 point). Non-warriors can gain exceptional strength this way. When the duration expires, the subject reverts to their normal strength, and then loses an equal amount to what they gained. The lost strength returns at a rate of 1 point per day. It is worth keeping in mind, that any character who reaches 0 strength dies.

Example: Lili the Cleric is fighting a giant with her necromancer friend Leoric. Leoric casts Unholy Strength on Lili, who chooses to give up 11 hp, raising her strength from 12 to 18/100. When the spell expires after defeating the giant, Lili looses 11 points of strength, bringing her to 1 strength. The next morning, she has regained 1 lost point of strength and is at 2 str. Three days later, she's at 5 strength. A week later, she's back at her full 12 strength. 

Non-willing subjects, including unconscious people, cannot be targeted with the spell, as part of the magic involves an internal agreement to relinquish HP. Similarly, the muscles of the subject are decayed and undead, giving the subject of the spell a stench of death and decay about them. "}</textarea>

Poison injected or otherwise introduced into the body takes effect when the spell recipient is no longer under the influence of this spell, although a saving throw is permitted.

Note that only a willing individual can be affected by feign death. The spellcaster can end the spell effects at any time desired, as will a successful dispel, but a full round is required for bodily functions to begin again."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">By means of this spell, the caster (or any other creature whose levels of experience or Hit Dice do not exceed the wizard&#039;s own level) can be put into a cataleptic state that is impossible to distinguish from death. Although the person or creature affected by the feign death spell can smell, hear, and know what is going on, no feeling or sight of any sort is possible. Thus any wounding or mistreatment of the body is not felt and no reaction occurs; damage is only 1/2 normal. In addition, paralysis, poison, or energy-level drain cannot affect an individual under the influence of this spell. <br /><br />Poison injected or otherwise introduced into the body takes effect when the spell recipient is no longer under the influence of this spell, although a saving throw is permitted.<br /><br />Note that only a willing individual can be affected by feign death. The spellcaster can end the spell effects at any time desired, as will a successful dispel, but a full round is required for bodily functions to begin again.</div>

"description":"By positioning a creature against a mirror, and marking their forehead with their own blood, the necromancer entombs the creature inside a mirror. The mirror must be of a size to hold the creature. Spells that change the size of the creature prevent the creature from being entombed until the spell is worn off. Similarly, mirrors that are magically changed in size are unsuitable for this task.

Once a creature is held in a mirror, it is in a state of two dimensional semi-stasis. The creature does not heal, does not age, has no need of food, drink, or bodily functions, yet they may still move and speak (if they were able to outside of the mirror). Furthermore, those trapped in the mirror find that their three dimensional belongings no longer function in two dimensional space: books cannot be read, potions cannot be consumed, itches cannot be scratched, etc. Creatures with magical abilities (spells, gazes, etc.) will find that their spells are restricted to the mirror dimension in which they are placed. A basilisk would not petrify someone looking at it, nor could a mage within a mirror cast Magic Missile at someone on the other side or at the mirror itself.

Creatures inside the mirror are aware of what is happening on the outside of the mirror, being able to see, hear, and smell. Similarly, creatures on the outside of the mirror and see and hear those trapped within. Those inside the mirror may walk around within the confines of the mirror, and may come into the foreground (between the onlooker and their reflection) or stay in the background (behind the reflection of creatures). 

If the mirror is broken or damaged (scratching the glass counts as damaged), the magic is broken, the mirror shatters, and the creature is freed, in the exact state it was originally imprisoned.

A shatter spell cast from within the mirror dimension will break the mirror. Spells that move between dimensions can be used as long as they do not require 3 dimensional space (A spell that opens a portal one walks through would not work, but a spell that shifts the caster from one dimension to another will). Teleportation has no effect.

A caster may not imprison themselves in a mirror."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell creates the lowest of the undead monsters - skeletons or zombies - usually from the bones or bodies of dead humans, demihumans, or humanoids. The spell causes existing remains to become animated and obey the simple verbal commands of the caster. 
The skeletons or zombies can follow the caster, remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific type of creature) entering the place, etc. The undead remain animated until they are destroyed in combat or are turned; the magic cannot be dispelled. The following types of dead creatures can be animated:

A) Humans, demihumans, and humanoids with 1 Hit Die. The wizard can animate one skeleton for each experience level he has attained, or one zombie for every two levels. The experience levels, if any, of the slain are ignored: the body of a newly dead 9th-level fighter is animated as a zombie with 2 Hit Dice, without special class or racial abilities.

B) Creatures with more than 1 Hit Die. The number of undead animated is determined by the monster Hit Dice (the total Hit Dice cannot exceed the wizards level). Skeletal forms have the Hit Dice of the original creature, while zombie forms have one more Hit Die. Thus, a 12th-level wizard could animate four zombie gnolls (4 x [2 + 1 Hit Dice]= 12), or a single fire giant skeleton. Such undead have none of the special abilities they had in life.

C) Creatures with less than 1 Hit Die. The caster can animate two skeletons per level or one zombie per level. The creatures have their normal Hit Dice as skeletons and an additional Hit Die as zombies, Clerics receive a +1 bonus when trying to turn these.

This spell assumes that the bodies or bones are available and are reasonably intact (those of skeletons or zombies destroyed in combat won't be!).

It requires a drop of blood and a pinch of bone powder or a bone shard to complete the spell. 

The casting of this spell is not a good act and only evil wizards use it frequently."}</textarea>

"description":"The magic jar spell enables the caster to shift his life force into a special receptacle (a gem or large crystal). From there the caster can force an exchange of life forces between the receptacle and another creature, thus enabling the wizard to take over and control the body of another creature, while the life force of the host is confined in the receptacle. The special life force receptacle must be within spell range of the wizard's body at the time of spellcasting. The wizard's life force shifts into the receptacle in the round in which the casting is completed, allowing no other actions.

While in the magic jar, the caster can sense and attack any life force within a 10-footper- level radius (on the same plane); however, the exact creature types and relative physical positions cannot be determined. In a group of life forces, the caster can sense a difference of four or more levels/Hit Dice and can determine whether a life force is positive or negative energy.

For example, if two 10th-level fighters are attacking a hill giant and four ogres, the caster could determine that there are three stronger and four weaker life forces within range, all with positive life energy. The caster could try to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but he has no control over exactly which creature is attacked.

An attempt to take over a host body requires a full round. It is blocked by a protection from evil spell or similar ward. It is successful only if the subject fails a saving throw vs. spell with a special modifier (see following). The saving throw is modified by subtracting the combined Intelligence and Wisdom scores of the target from those of the wizard

(Intelligence and Hit Dice in nonhuman or nonhumanoid creatures). This modifier is added to (or subtracted from) the die roll. (See book for table).

A negative score indicates that the wizard has a lower total than the target; thus, the host has a saving throw bonus. Failure to take over the host leaves the wizard's life force in the magic jar.

If successful, the caster's life force occupies the host body and the host's life force is confined in the magic jar receptacle. The caster can call upon rudimentary or instinctive knowledge of the subject creature, but not upon its real or acquired knowledge (i.e., the wizard does not automatically know the language or spells of the creature). The caster retains his own attack rolls, class knowledge and training, and any adjustments due to his Intelligence or Wisdom. If the host body is human or humanoid, and the necessary spell components are available, the wizard can even use his memorized spells. The host body retains its own hit points and physical abilities and properties. The DM decides if any additional modifications are necessary; for example, perhaps clumsiness or inefficiency occurs if the caster must become used to the new form. The alignment of the host or receptacle is that of the occupying life force.

The caster can shift freely from the host to the receptacle if within the 10-foot-per-level range. Each attempt to shift requires one round. The spell ends when the wizard shifts from the jar to his own body.

A successful dispel magic spell cast on the host can drive the caster of the magic jar spell back into the receptacle and prevent him from making any attacks for 1d4 rounds plus 1 round per level of the caster of the dispel. The base success chance is 50%, plus or minus 5% per level difference between the casters. A successful dispel magic cast against the receptacle forces the occupant back into his own body. If the wizard who cast the magic jar is forced back into his own body, the spell ends.

If the host body is slain, the caster returns to the receptacle, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (i.e., it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both the host and the caster die.

Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain unless recalled by a raise dead, resurrection, or similar spell.

If the body of the caster is slain, his life force survives if it is in either the receptacle or the host. If the receptacle is destroyed while the caster's life force occupies it, the caster is irrevocably slain."}</textarea>

As it flies, it utters hideous screeches that echo through the sky. The spectral steed flies at a movement rate of 4 per level of the caster, to a maximum movement rate of 48. It appears with a bit and bridle, plus one saddle per passenger.<br /><br />All normal animals shun the spectral steed and only monsters will attack it. The mount has AC 18 and 10 hit points plus 1 hit point per level of the caster. If it loses all of its hit points, the spectral steed disappears. It has no attack mode.<br /><br />The material component is a hollow bone from a vulture</div>

"description":"When a death spell is cast, it snuffs out the life forces of creatures in the area of effect instantly and irrevocably. Such creatures cannot be raised or resurrected, but an individual slain in this manner might be brought back via a wish. The number of creatures that can be slain is a function of their Hit Dice. (See book for table ).

In other words, from the 4d20 roll subtract the number of creatures of less than 2 Hit Dice (these creatures die). If there are any remaining points from the 4d20 roll, subtract 2 for each creature of 2 to 4 Hit Dice (these creatures also die). If this still doesn't use up all the 4d20 roll, subtract 10 for each creature of 4+1 to 6+3 Hit Dice, and so on. Stop when all the creatures are dead, all the 4d20 roll is used up, or the remainder is less than half the CF of any remaining creatures. (If the remainder is one-half or more of the CF of a creature, that creature dies.)

For example, a mixed group of 20 goblins, eight gnolls, and four ogres, led by a hill giant, are caught in the area of a death spell. The 4d20 roll gives a total of 53 points; 20 of this eliminates the goblins (20 x 1 CF), 16 kills the gnolls (8 x 2 CF), and the remaining 17 kills two ogres (10 points to kill one ogre, and the remaining 7 points are enough to kill one more ogre). The other two ogres and the hill giant are unharmed.

A death spell does not affect lycanthropes, undead creatures, or creatures from planes other than the Prime Material.

The material component of this spell is a crushed black pearl with a minimum value of 1,000 gp."}</textarea>

If the caster is reduced to less than 0 hit points, he is incapacitated and must make a system shock roll or lose all of his highest level spells. The incapacitation lasts only until his regeneration restores him to 1 hit point or more; he can move fight, and cast spells again as soon as his hit point total is positive.

Trollish fortitude does not provide the caster with any defenses against lethal position, disease, and other effects level draining, vampiric touch, or vampiric regeneration cannot be regenerated since this represents damage to the victim's life force and not physical injury. In addition, fire damage and acid damage cannot be regenerated. While the spell is in effect, the caster can rejoin severed limbs simply by holding them in place, but if the spell ends while a limb(which were already moving toward him) is still separate from his body, he immediately suffers the full effects of the injury.

The material component for this spell is a shred of dried flesh from a troll's heart that must be pulverized into dust. The dust is then sprinkled on the caster."}</textarea>

person and the clone will each desire to do away with the other, for such an alter-ego is unbearable to both. If one cannot destroy the other, one will go insane and destroy itself (90% likely to be the clone), or possibly both will become mad and destroy themselves (2% chance). These events nearly always occur within one week of the dual existence.
  Note that the clone is the person as he existed at the time at which the flesh was taken for the spell component, and all subsequent knowledge, experience, etc., is totally unknown to the clone. The clone is a physical duplicate, and possessions of the original are another matter entirely. A clone takes 2d4 months to grow, and only after that time is
dual existence established. Furthermore, the clone has one less Constitution point than the body it was cloned from; the cloning fails if the clone would have a Constitution of 0.
  The material component of the spell is a small piece of the flesh from the person to be duplicated.
  The DM may, in addition, add other stipulations to the success of a cloning effort,requiring that some trace of life must remain in the flesh sample, that some means of storing and preserving the sample must be devised and maintained, etc."}</textarea>

"description":"  This potent spell exchanges the necromancer's own living heart for a finely crafted heart of perfect,unblemished stone that alters the very nature of the wizard's body.As long as the heart of stone remains in effect,the caster need not fear attacks that pierce,slash,or cut him;he does not bleed and can ignore the most horrible injuries of this kind.The caster can also ignore most magical effects such as spell,magical devices,and innate spell abilities of less than 8th level.
   In game terms,the character suffers only 1 point of damage from any type S or type P attack,plus any magical adjustment for the weapon.For example,if struck by a long sword +1,he would suffer only 2 points of damage.Strength and specialization bonuses are ignored.If the wizard is dismembered,he suffers no additional damage other than the inconvenience of having his limbs removed,and he can reattach a severed limb by holding it in place for one full turn.The heart of stone is also partially effective against type B attacks since it prevents bruising,swelling,and crushed blood vessels.Against bludgeoning weapons,the wizard only suffers half the normal damage.Cause wound spell always inflict minimum damage against a wizard protected by this spell.While the caster may not feel a sword in his rib cage,any damage sustained interrupts spellcasting.
    In addition to resisting injury,the heart of stone also renders the character immune to fatigue and exhaustion,whether normal or magical.He also gains a +4 bonus to saving throws vs,petrification attacks.
   While the heart of stone is quite powerful,it has limitations.First of all,determined physical attack can eventually destroy the wizard despite his unnatural resistance to injury-a mob of angry peasants with hatchets and spears can finish him off 1 point at a time if that's what it takes.
Second,the heart confers no protection against other attack forms,such as fire,electricity,cold,acid,and so on,although any bleeding caused by a burn is ignored.Disintegration effects also affect the caster.Most importantly,the caster loses the ability to naturally recover from injury and no longer regains lost hit points with the passage of time.Healing spells,potions and items are reduced to their minimum effect,so a cure serious wounds (2d8+1 hit points restored)would only return 3 hit points to a wizard protected by heart of stone.However,limited wish or wish can be used to restore 1 hit point per level of caster or all but 1d4 hit points,respectively.
  In addition to these disadvantages,heart of stone also renders the caster vulnerable in one other way;his own real heart can be destroyed,instantly slaying him.Naturally,the caster will want to take steps to hide and protect his true heart to prevent this happening.The living heart continues to beat for the duration of the spell but requires no special receptacle or facilities to protect it-the caster could leave it lying on the floor,if he wished.
     The heart of stone cannot be dispelled,although a more powerful negation magic such as Mordenkainen's disjunction can bring the spell to an end.Stone to flesh also undoes the magic of the heart of stone.No matter how the spell is ended,the wizard's own living heart instantly returns to its proper place,and the stone heart appears wherever the living heart was kept.At this time,any injuries the wizard currently has are multiplied by 1d6 as the wounds begin to bleed again.For example,a necromancer who was injured for 6 points of damage instead suffers 6d6 when the spell ends.
      The material component for this spell is the stone heart itself.This must be a carved stone of quality (jade,obsidian,or gold-veined marble would be appropriate)worth not less than 5,000 gold pieces.It must be prepared by use of the enchant an item spell.The stone is not consumed at the spell's end and may be used again if it is undamaged.
