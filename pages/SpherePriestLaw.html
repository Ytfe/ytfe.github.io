"description":"This spell temporarily calms a chaotic situation involving a group of people. The situation may involve any range of emotions from violence (as in a barroom brawl) to joy and merrymaking (as in a festival or carnival).
Unlike the emotion spell, calm chaos does not cause a change in the emotions of affected creatures--anger, fear, or intense joy remain in each individual. The emotion is simply restrained rather than released. Thus, an angry character intent on attacking someone will still feel the desire to do so, but he will withhold his action as long as the spell remains in effect.
Creatures to be affected are allowed a saving throw vs. spell at a -4 penalty to avoid the effects. If more creatures are present than can be affected, creatures nearest the caster are affected first.
After casting the spell, the priest makes a Charisma check. If successful, all characters affected by the spell are compelled to stop what they are doing. They are filled with the sensation that something important is about to occur. At this time, the priest or a character of his choosing must gain the attention of the affected creatures by giving a speech, performing for the crowd, or casting spells with intriguing visual effects (such as dancing lights). The attention of the crowd is then held for as long as the distraction continues. A character could filibuster and maintain control over the affected characters for hours or days.
Two conditions will cause the group to resume its original actions. In the first, the method of entertaining the crowd ceases for one round--the speech ends or the spell expires. If this action is not replaced with another distraction within one round, the crowd is freed of the spell.
In the second condition, if an event occurs that is more immediate than the distraction, the crowd will divert its attention to that event. Thus, if the spell were used to stop a barroom brawl and the building caught fire or was attacked, the crowd's attention would be diverted and the individuals could act freely.
Creatures whose attention is held by the spell cannot be instructed to attack or perform any action. Such creatures will ignore suggestions of this nature. Depending on the nature of the request, the DM may deem that the suggestion causes a distraction that ends the spell."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell holds 1d4 humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile and in place for a minimum of six rounds (the spell lasts 2 rounds per caster level, and the priest must be of at least 3rd level to cast the spell).
The hold person spell affects any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man size or smaller, including brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, halfelves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be held, while an ogre could not.
The effect is centered on a point selected by the caster, and it affects persons selected by the caster within the area of effect. If the spell is cast at three persons, each gets a normal saving throw; if only two persons are being enspelled, each rolls his saving throw with a -1 penalty; if the spell is cast at only one person, the saving throw die roll suffers a -2 penalty. Saving throws are adjusted for Wisdom. Those who succeed on their saving throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.
Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison. The priest casting the hold person spell can end the spell with a single utterance at any time; otherwise, the duration is six rounds at 3rd level, eight rounds at 4th level, etc.
The spellcaster needs a small, straight piece of iron as the material component of this spell."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">This spell holds 1d4 humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile and in place for a minimum of six rounds (the spell lasts 2 rounds per caster level, and the priest must be of at least 3rd level to cast the spell).<br />The hold person spell affects any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man size or smaller, including brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, halfelves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be held, while an ogre could not.<br />The effect is centered on a point selected by the caster, and it affects persons selected by the caster within the area of effect. If the spell is cast at three persons, each gets a normal saving throw; if only two persons are being enspelled, each rolls his saving throw with a -1 penalty; if the spell is cast at only one person, the saving throw die roll suffers a -2 penalty. Saving throws are adjusted for Wisdom. Those who succeed on their saving throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.<br />Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects&#039; condition due to wounds, disease, or poison. The priest casting the hold person spell can end the spell with a single utterance at any time; otherwise, the duration is six rounds at 3rd level, eight rounds at 4th level, etc.<br />The spellcaster needs a small, straight piece of iron as the material component of this spell.</div>

The dictate spell is an improved version of command, affecting up to 6 creatures in a 20-foot cube. The caster is not limited to a single word and can issue an order of no more than a dozen words in length. All the specified targets who fail their saving throws must attempt to obey the caster's instructions. For example, a priest could issue a dictate such as \"Stay here until I return,\" \"Throw down your weapons,\" or \"Seize that elf!\" The subjects will continue to obey non-immediate orders for up to one round per experience level of the caster.
Subjects who cannot understand the caster are not affected, so characters who do not understand the caster's language are immune to this spell. In addition, the order must Detect Spirits Dictate create an immediate and obvious course of action for the subject; a dictate to \"Die!\" or \"Feel sorry for him!\" would simply cause the subject to stand still in confusion for one round. Poorly worded or confusing commands grant the subjects a +1 to +4 bonus on their saving throws at the DM's discretion. Similarly, if after the subject fails his saving throw he is given an obviously self-destructive dictate, the subject simply loses his next round as he fights off the compulsion."}</textarea>

Anyone affected by compulsive order may become violent if he is prevented from being neat. He will do what he must to make the world around him more orderly.

"description":"Champion's strength bestows one member of a group with attack and damage bonuses from the rest of the group. The recipient of the spell can then fight as the group's champion.
The spell draws bonuses from one person for every two levels of the priest. All characters involved must be within a 30'-radius of the priest. At the time of casting, the priest designates the recipient of the spell and the contributors. All characters who contribute to the spell must do so willingly.
When the spell is completed, the designated character (the group's champion) gains any non-magical bonuses to THAC0 and damage possessed by the characters who contributed to the spell. Characters without bonuses or with combat penalties could conceivably be included in the spell; such characters count against the maximum number of creatures that can be affected. Penalties are likewise applied to the champion; contributors to this spell must be chosen carefully.
The bonuses gained through this spell are added to the character's own bonuses (if any). The champion channels the energy of others through himself, improving his fighting ability.
The champion must be in the line of sight and within 30 feet of the characters aiding him. Characters who contribute their bonuses must concentrate on the champion for the duration of the spell. If this concentration is broken (by moving more than 10 feet per round, fighting, being struck, or losing sight of the champion), that character's contribution is immediately lost.
The spell expires when the last character contributing power to the champion ceases concentration.
A champion may benefit from only one champion's strength spell at one time.
Contributors can aid only one champion at one time.
The material component is a chain of five gold links worth at least 1,000 gp."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">Champion&#039;s strength bestows one member of a group with attack and damage bonuses from the rest of the group. The recipient of the spell can then fight as the group&#039;s champion.<br />The spell draws bonuses from one person for every two levels of the priest. All characters involved must be within a 30&#039;-radius of the priest. At the time of casting, the priest designates the recipient of the spell and the contributors. All characters who contribute to the spell must do so willingly.<br />When the spell is completed, the designated character (the group&#039;s champion) gains any non-magical bonuses to THAC0 and damage possessed by the characters who contributed to the spell. Characters without bonuses or with combat penalties could conceivably be included in the spell; such characters count against the maximum number of creatures that can be affected. Penalties are likewise applied to the champion; contributors to this spell must be chosen carefully.<br />The bonuses gained through this spell are added to the character&#039;s own bonuses (if any). The champion channels the energy of others through himself, improving his fighting ability.<br />The champion must be in the line of sight and within 30 feet of the characters aiding him. Characters who contribute their bonuses must concentrate on the champion for the duration of the spell. If this concentration is broken (by moving more than 10 feet per round, fighting, being struck, or losing sight of the champion), that character&#039;s contribution is immediately lost.<br />The spell expires when the last character contributing power to the champion ceases concentration.<br />A champion may benefit from only one champion&#039;s strength spell at one time.<br />Contributors can aid only one champion at one time.<br />The material component is a chain of five gold links worth at least 1,000 gp.</div>

"description":"This spell may be cast only on creatures with Intelligence of 2 or greater and the ability to communicate with the caster. The spell interferes with the victim's ability to make decisions. It prevents the victim from performing any action without first gaining the permission of the caster or a character designated by the caster. The victim will heed only the person designated by the caster.
Before the victim undertakes any action, he must gain permission. He will not follow through with an action until he gains permission. If permission is denied, the victim cannot act until he thinks of an alternate action and gains permission for that action.
Every round, the victim must decide his action for that round; at the victim's initiative, he must ask permission to perform his action. If permission is denied, the victim can take no other action that round.
The only actions exempt from the need for permission are involuntary actions such as breathing.
Asking and gaining permission takes only a short amount of time in most cases. A simple request, such as asking for permission to swing a sword in the middle of combat, can be accomplished quickly. Complicated requests, such as getting permission to act on a complicated plan, will naturally take more time. The DM may consider adding a modifier to the victim's initiative roll in such cases."}</textarea>

First, a prayer spell is continuously operative in the area of effect, shifting the balance of combat probabilities toward the favor of the priest who casts this spell and his companions.

For example, if a roll of 11 or better is needed to save against a spell effect, this is a 50% chance for success.

Creatures friendly to the cleric gain corresponding bonuses--+2 to saving throws, +1 to attack and damage rolls, and a bonus of 1 to AC.
Additional effects are possible, depending on the Power granting the spell; effects must correspond (or at least not conflict) with the spheres the priest normally uses. Multiple effects are possible.
The variation for the Sphere of Wards requires that each hostile creature entering the area of effect make a saving throw vs. spells with a -4 penalty or suffer 4d6 points of damage. An affected creature must then flee the area; it is unable to return. The creature must make a second saving throw vs. spell with a -4 penalty as it leaves the area or be blinded until magically cured.
The variation for the sphere of Law requires that a hostile creature make a saving throw every time it wishes to change an action. Thus, if a creature wishes to stop running and draw a weapon, a successful save is needed or the creature continues to run. Actions that cannot be continued (e.g., firing an arrow if the archer has no more arrows) are repeated as empty automatisms. In addition, creatures hostile to the priest automatically fail saving throws against Enchantment/Charm spells cast by the priest.
The variation for the Sphere of Chaos requires that hostile creatures make saving throws vs. spells at -4 or be affected by confusion (as per the spell). Affected creatures have a 5% chance per round of suddenly being attacked by a phantasmal killer.
All creatures who enter the area of effect are subject to the effects of the spell. All effects except blindness cease 3 rounds after an affected creature leaves the area.
