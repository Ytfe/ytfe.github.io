"description":"One of the more bizarre contentions held by priests of the School of Thought is generally scoffed at by outsiders. The theory states that once a thought has occurred in someone's brain, it exists as a \"freestanding mental object.\" This \"thought object\" usually remains inside the brain of the creature that created it, but sometimes it escapes (this supposedly explains why people forget things). When this happens, the thought object stays in the geographical area where it was lost. Any receptive brain (usually the brain of the creature that initially created the thought) can pick it up again simply by bumping into the invisible, free-floating thought. According to the theory, this is the reason that people can regain a lost thought by going back to the location where the thought was lost. This supposedly works because the free-floating thought is recaptured, not because the locale reminds them of the thought. Unfortunately for philosophers who disagree with this, thought capture seems to be extremely strong evidence for this theory.
This spell makes the priest's brain something of a magnet that attracts thought objects in close proximity. The priest can sense strong thoughts and emotions and can sometimes even see momentary visions of creatures who died or suffered some powerful emotion in the immediate vicinity. Thought objects are always attracted to the priest in the order of the strongest (those attached to powerful emotions or significant events) to the weakest.
Thus, if several thought objects share the same vicinity, the priest will perceive information about the most interesting or significant event. The priest might pick up images of a battle from the point of view of a warrior who died there, or he might gain information about the victor of the battle.
The DM dictates the information provided to the priest, and thus can use this spell to provide players with important background information or can add texture to a campaign world. The information provided might be highly cryptic or symbolic, perhaps in the form of a rhyme or riddle.
The priest gains one thought object per casting of the spell. The spell may be cast a number of times in the same locale, with the priest gaining a different thought object with each casting. A locale contains a finite number of thoughts, however, and once the priest has gained all of them (per the DM), the spell will fail in that locale."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell can be cast in one of two ways: in a manner that affects the priest, or in a manner that affects a subject other than the priest.
The first method affects only the priest and allows him to shield his true emotions from magical examination. Thus, it can block wizard spells such as ESP or priest spells such as emotion read. While emotion control is in effect, anyone using one of these spells will sense the emotion designated by the priest rather than his true emotions. When the priest casts emotion control, he designates the false emotion he wishes to be revealed.
This use of emotion control also gives the priest a +2 bonus to saving throws against the following spells: spook, taunt, irritation, know alignment, scare, emotion, fear, and phantasmal killer. When any of these spells are cast on the priest, he is immediately aware of the attempt, although he does not learn the source of the spell.
If another character casts emotion read, ESP, or a similar spell on the priest, the priest must make a saving throw vs. spells with a +1 bonus for each 5 levels of the priest. If the priest successfully saves, the other spellcaster reads the false emotion; if the priest fails the saving throw, the spellcaster reads the priest's true emotion.
The second use of this spell allows the priest to create a single emotional reaction in the subject(s) (similar to the wizard spell emotion). Some typical emotions follow, but the DM may allow other similar effects.
Courage: The subject becomes berserk, gaining +1 to attack rolls and +3 to damage, and temporarily gaining 4 hit points (damage against the subject is deducted from these temporary points first). The subject need never check morale, and receives a +5 bonus to saving throws against the various forms of fear. Courage counters (and is countered by) fear.
Fear: The subject flees from the priest for the duration of the spell, even if this takes him out of spell range. Fear counters (and is countered by) courage.
Friendship: The subject reacts positively to any encounter; in game terms, any result of a roll on the Encounter Reactions table (Table 59 in the DMG ) is moved one column to the left. Thus, a threatening PC becomes cautious, an indifferent PC becomes friendly, etc. Friendship counters (and is countered by) hate.
Happiness: The subject experiences feelings of warmth, well-being, and confidence, modifying all reaction rolls by +3. The subject is unlikely to attack unless provoked.
Happiness counters (and is countered by) sadness.
Hate: The subject reacts negatively to any encounter; in game terms, any result of a roll on the Encounter Reactions table is moved one column to the right (i.e., a friendly PC becomes indifferent, a cautious PC becomes threatening, etc.). Hate counters (and is countered by) friendship.
Hope: The subject's morale is improved by +2. His saving throw rolls, attack, and damage rolls are all improved by +1 while this emotion is in effect. Hope counters (and is countered by) hopelessness.
Hopelessness: The subject's morale suffers a -10 penalty. In addition, in the round in which the emotion is initially established, all subjects must immediately make a morale check. Hopelessness counters (and is countered by) hope.
Sadness: The subject feels uncontrollably glum and is prone to fits of morose introspection. All attack rolls suffer a -1 penalty and initiative rolls suffer a +1 penalty.
The subject's chance of being surprised is increased by -2. Sadness counters (and is countered by) happiness.
All subjects of the second version, even willing targets, must save vs. spell to resist the emotion. In addition to all other modifiers, the saving throw is modified by -1 for every three levels of the priest casting the spell.

				<div class="description-content">This spell can be cast in one of two ways: in a manner that affects the priest, or in a manner that affects a subject other than the priest.<br />The first method affects only the priest and allows him to shield his true emotions from magical examination. Thus, it can block wizard spells such as ESP or priest spells such as emotion read. While emotion control is in effect, anyone using one of these spells will sense the emotion designated by the priest rather than his true emotions. When the priest casts emotion control, he designates the false emotion he wishes to be revealed.<br />This use of emotion control also gives the priest a +2 bonus to saving throws against the following spells: spook, taunt, irritation, know alignment, scare, emotion, fear, and phantasmal killer. When any of these spells are cast on the priest, he is immediately aware of the attempt, although he does not learn the source of the spell.<br />If another character casts emotion read, ESP, or a similar spell on the priest, the priest must make a saving throw vs. spells with a +1 bonus for each 5 levels of the priest. If the priest successfully saves, the other spellcaster reads the false emotion; if the priest fails the saving throw, the spellcaster reads the priest&#039;s true emotion.<br />The second use of this spell allows the priest to create a single emotional reaction in the subject(s) (similar to the wizard spell emotion). Some typical emotions follow, but the DM may allow other similar effects.<br />Courage: The subject becomes berserk, gaining +1 to attack rolls and +3 to damage, and temporarily gaining 4 hit points (damage against the subject is deducted from these temporary points first). The subject need never check morale, and receives a +5 bonus to saving throws against the various forms of fear. Courage counters (and is countered by) fear.<br />Fear: The subject flees from the priest for the duration of the spell, even if this takes him out of spell range. Fear counters (and is countered by) courage.<br />Friendship: The subject reacts positively to any encounter; in game terms, any result of a roll on the Encounter Reactions table (Table 59 in the DMG ) is moved one column to the left. Thus, a threatening PC becomes cautious, an indifferent PC becomes friendly, etc. Friendship counters (and is countered by) hate.<br />Happiness: The subject experiences feelings of warmth, well-being, and confidence, modifying all reaction rolls by +3. The subject is unlikely to attack unless provoked.<br />Happiness counters (and is countered by) sadness.<br />Hate: The subject reacts negatively to any encounter; in game terms, any result of a roll on the Encounter Reactions table is moved one column to the right (i.e., a friendly PC becomes indifferent, a cautious PC becomes threatening, etc.). Hate counters (and is countered by) friendship.<br />Hope: The subject&#039;s morale is improved by +2. His saving throw rolls, attack, and damage rolls are all improved by +1 while this emotion is in effect. Hope counters (and is countered by) hopelessness.<br />Hopelessness: The subject&#039;s morale suffers a -10 penalty. In addition, in the round in which the emotion is initially established, all subjects must immediately make a morale check. Hopelessness counters (and is countered by) hope.<br />Sadness: The subject feels uncontrollably glum and is prone to fits of morose introspection. All attack rolls suffer a -1 penalty and initiative rolls suffer a +1 penalty.<br />The subject&#039;s chance of being surprised is increased by -2. Sadness counters (and is countered by) happiness.<br />All subjects of the second version, even willing targets, must save vs. spell to resist the emotion. In addition to all other modifiers, the saving throw is modified by -1 for every three levels of the priest casting the spell.<br />The material component for both versions of the spell is a small bunch of fleece or uncarded wool that is consumed in the casting.</div>

"description":"This spell establishes direct, two-way mental contact between the priest and a single subject. The subject must have Intelligence of at least 5 for the spell to take effect. While the spell is in effect, the two participants can communicate silently and rapidly, regardless of whether they share a common language.

Telepathy does not give either participant access to the other's thoughts, memories, or emotions. Participants can only \"hear\" the thoughts that the other participant actively \"sends.\" Mind-to-mind communication is approximately four times faster than verbal communication. The level of complexity that can be communicated is only that which can be expressed through language. Gestures, expressions, and body language cannot be conveyed.

A priest can establish separate \"telepathic channels\" to multiple individuals. Each linkage is established through a separate casting of the spell. There is no network between the channels. For example, Balfas the priest establishes telepathy with Alra the warrior and Zymor the thief by casting this spell twice. Balfas can communicate a single thought to both Alra and Zymor, but Alra and Zymor cannot communicate with each other. Balfas, however, can \"target\" a thought so that only one of the two participants receives it.

If the priest casts this spell on an unwilling subject (for example, if the priest wants to silently threaten or taunt the subject), the subject receives a saving throw vs. spell to resist the effect. Willing subjects need not make a saving throw.

Elves and half-elves have no innate resistance to this spell. Priest and subject need not share a common language. The priest can force the subject into combat, but the subject's attack rolls suffer a -2 penalty. The priest cannot force the subject to cast spells or use any innate magical or magiclike abilities. The priest can force the subject to speak, although the priest cannot inject a full range of emotions into the subject's voice (everything said by the subject is in a monotone).
This spell gives the priest no access to the subject's thoughts, memory, or sensory apparatus. Thus, the priest cannot see through the subject's eyes. To control the subject, the priest must be within the range of the spell and must be able to see the subject.
Breaking either of these conditions causes the spell to terminate immediately.
This spell requires a moderate level of concentration by the priest. While maintaining this spell, he can move or enter combat, but cannot cast another spell. If the priest is wounded, rendered unconscious, or killed, the spell immediately terminates.
If the priest is 10th level or lower, he or she cannot force the subject to perform particularly delicate actions, such as picking a lock. At 11th level or higher, however, this restriction is removed. The priest could thus force a thief to pick a lock. Any such delicate actions suffer a -15% penalty (or -3 on 1d20) to reflect the \"remote control\" nature of the action.
The material component is a mesh of fine threads that the priest loops around the fingertips of one hand and manipulates in the way that a puppeteer controls a puppet."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell turns the subject into a \"thought broadcaster.\" For the duration of the spell, everyone within 30 yards of the subject senses the subject's thoughts, making it impossible for him to lie, keep secrets, conceal motives, etc. The subject is not automatically aware that his thoughts are being sensed. Everyone who senses these thoughts, on the other hand, knows their source.
This spell causes the broadcast of only surface thoughts and motivations, not memories. There is no need for a common language between broadcaster and receivers; for this purpose, thoughts are considered to be symbolic, not dependent on language. The detail level of the thoughts is insufficient for others to learn specific skills from the subject. Thus, if the subject casts a spell, everyone within range knows what spell is being cast before it takes effect, but no one learns any knowledge about how the spell is cast.
If the broadcaster is invisible or hiding in shadows, the broadcast functions normally, and all receivers are aware that someone is in the vicinity whom they cannot see. While receivers cannot pinpoint the broadcaster's location, the broadcaster's thoughts will inevitably reveal his general position (\"Oh no, he's looking right at me,\" etc.). A character hiding in shadows will be automatically detected, while attacks against an invisible broadcaster suffer a -2 penalty, rather than the normal -4. This spell totally negates the chance of surprise by the broadcaster.
The subject must have an Intelligence score of 1 or more to become a broadcaster, and must have a \"normal\" mind as understood by PCs. Thoughts that are broadcast can be received only by individuals with Intelligence scores of 3 or better. An unwilling subject receives a normal saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effects. A willing subject can waive this saving throw.
The material component is small balloon that the priest inflates upon casting. This balloon is consumed in the casting."}</textarea>

"description":"This nasty spell \"disconnects\" the subject's short-term and long-term memory. While the spell is in effect, the subject is incapable of storing information in long-term memory.
Every moment is virtually an independent event for the subject; he or she can remember recent events, thoughts, and sensations for no more than a few seconds (the amount of time they remain in short-term memory).
Memories of events that happened before the onset of the spell are not affected at all; these are safely stored in long-term memory. This means that the subject can cast any spells memorized before the memory wrack took effect, but he is likely to have difficulty casting the spell as described below.
The subject of this spell has a limited ability to act. He is restricted to one action at a time and must concentrate mightily to keep the situation and any planned actions in shortterm memory. As long as the subject is able to maintain concentration, he may act normally within these limits.
If the subject is distracted (he is struck in combat, affected by a spell, startled, surprised, or a similar event occurs), he forgets everything that occurred from the onset of the spell to the moment of distraction. The subject must re-evaluate the situation as if it had just come to pass.
Consider the following example. The subject of the spell is a soldier assigned to guard the entrance to a building. The priest arrives and casts memory wrack on the guard.
The guard has no problem remembering his orders, since he received them before the onset of the spell. He also remembers the arrival of the priest. The priest now tries to convince the guard that he is authorized to enter the building. The guard refuses him entry. The priest now picks up a rock and throws it at the guard, striking him and distracting him. The guard forgets everything that happened between the onset of the spell and the moment the rock struck. He forgets that the priest has already tried to con him and that he threw a rock at him. He must reevaluate the situation as though the priest had just arrived. The priest is free to make another attempt at entering the building.
When the spell expires, the subject remembers nothing that happened while the spell was in effect, possibly leading to amusing consequences (\"By the gods, how did I get here?\").
The material component is a ruby of at least 200 gp value, which is crushed during the casting."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell allows the priest to create one specific form of insanity in the subject. Five forms of insanity are possible through this spell.
Schizophrenia: This form of insanity is characterized by personality loss. The subject has no personality of his own, so he selects a role model and makes every possible attempt to behave like that character. The chosen role model will be as different from the subject as possible. (Thus, an insane wizard might begin to follow the habits of a warrior.) Obviously, a warrior who believes himself to be a wizard will be unable to cast spells (he might think that he's casting spells, or he might construct a sophisticated series of excuses explaining why he's \"not in the mood for magic\" at the moment). A character who emulates a member of another class does not gain any of the skills of that class and makes all attacks and saving throws as appropriate to his true class. Certain consequences might arise if the character's emulation causes him to break restrictions of his class. For example, a priest emulating a warrior might break his deity's prohibition against edged weapons, or a paladin might emulate a Neutral Evil thief. Both will suffer the appropriate consequences as if they had been compelled to violate their beliefs while charmed. Such characters will certainly have to atone for their actions once they return to normal.
Dementia praecox: The subject is totally uninterested in any undertaking. Nothing seems worthwhile, and the individual is lethargic and filled with tremendous feelings of boredom and dissatisfaction. No matter how important the situation, it is 50% likely that the subject will ignore it as meaningless.
Delusional insanity: The subject is convinced that he is a famous figure: a monarch, demi-god, or similar personage. Characters who fail to recognize the subject with the honor he deserves incur great hostility or disbelief. The subject acts appropriately to a station that he does not hold. He directs orders at real and imaginary creatures and draws upon resources that do not exist.
Paranoia: The subject is convinced that \"they\" (whoever they are) are spying on him and plotting against him. Everyone around the subject, even friends and allies, is part of the plot. If any other character acts in a way that the subject can interpret as reinforcing this delusion, the subject has a 20% chance of reacting with violence.
Hallucinatory insanity: The subject sees, hears, and otherwise senses things that do not exist. The more stressful the situation is to the subject, the more likely he will hallucinate. Although most hallucinations are external to the subject (that is, he perceives creatures, objects, and conditions that do not exist), there is a 10% chance that any hallucination will involve the subject's self-perception. For example, the subject might suddenly believe and act as if he had sprouted wings, grown to giant size, etc.
When this spell is cast by a priest of 13th level or lower, the DM chooses or randomly selects one of these forms of insanity (and should feel free to invent other interesting symptoms). If the priest is 14th level or higher, he can personally select the form of insanity to afflict the subject.
While under the effect of this spell, the subject can cast spells and use innate powers; the use of these abilities will be in accordance with the symptoms of the insanity, however. Player characters affected by this spell should be encouraged to role-play the appropriate effects to the limit.
The duration of this spell depends on the sum of the subject's Intelligence and Wisdom scores. A saving throw is allowed on a periodic basis depending on this total.
The spell is broken if a successful saving throw is rolled. Refer to the table that follows.
Int+Wis Time Between Checks 8 or less 1 month 9 to 18 3 weeks 19 to 24 2 weeks 25 to 30 1 week 31 to 35 3 days 36 or more 1 day The effects of this spell can be removed by a limited wish, wish (or equally powerful magic), or by a heal spell cast for this specific purpose.
The material component is a small bust of a human head, about 3\" in height, made from fine, delicate china. The priest shatters this bust during the casting."}</textarea>

"description":"This cooperative spell can be cast by either a single priest or a group of priests.
Thoughtwave allows the priest to send a short but powerful message to one or more specific individuals, informing them of his situation and general location. The spell instantly generates a powerful mental impulse indicative of the caster's general mental state--anger, fear, pain, despair, etc.
The caster can designate as many as ten persons to receive this message, provided they can all be specifically named or grouped in a general category. Thus, the caster could designate a group of characters by name or could target \"fellow priests,\" \"superiors,\" \"adventuring companions,\" \"knights of Lord Harcourt,\" or \"villagers of Dopp.\" If more than ten individuals are in the group, those closest to the source will receive the impulse.
There is no range limitation to the spell, although it cannot be projected outside the plane occupied by the caster.
Creatures receiving the impulse automatically know who sent it (even if they have never met the priest before) and gain a clear indication of the mood and situation of the caster. Recipients also intuitively know the general source of the spell, although they are unable to pinpoint rooms, dungeon levels, or landmarks. For example, a fighter could suddenly be struck by an image of Father Rastibon, who is injured and in great pain somewhere along the forest road. A priest might suddenly sense that his patriarch is being tortured in the dungeons of Castle Varrack.
The spell can also be cast by more than one priest, allowing them to either contact greater numbers of individuals or increase the intensity of the message. If greater numbers are desired, ten characters are contacted per priest involved in the casting.
Increasing the intensity of the message makes it more compelling. Doubling the intensity (requiring at least three priests) causes the message to act as a suggestion. In this case, the effect is limited to a single target. Tripling the intensity (requiring at least five priests) gives the spell the force of a quest. This effect is also limited to a single target.

				<div class="description-content">This cooperative spell can be cast by either a single priest or a group of priests.<br />Thoughtwave allows the priest to send a short but powerful message to one or more specific individuals, informing them of his situation and general location. The spell instantly generates a powerful mental impulse indicative of the caster&#039;s general mental state--anger, fear, pain, despair, etc.<br />The caster can designate as many as ten persons to receive this message, provided they can all be specifically named or grouped in a general category. Thus, the caster could designate a group of characters by name or could target &quot;fellow priests,&quot; &quot;superiors,&quot; &quot;adventuring companions,&quot; &quot;knights of Lord Harcourt,&quot; or &quot;villagers of Dopp.&quot; If more than ten individuals are in the group, those closest to the source will receive the impulse.<br />There is no range limitation to the spell, although it cannot be projected outside the plane occupied by the caster.<br />Creatures receiving the impulse automatically know who sent it (even if they have never met the priest before) and gain a clear indication of the mood and situation of the caster. Recipients also intuitively know the general source of the spell, although they are unable to pinpoint rooms, dungeon levels, or landmarks. For example, a fighter could suddenly be struck by an image of Father Rastibon, who is injured and in great pain somewhere along the forest road. A priest might suddenly sense that his patriarch is being tortured in the dungeons of Castle Varrack.<br />The spell can also be cast by more than one priest, allowing them to either contact greater numbers of individuals or increase the intensity of the message. If greater numbers are desired, ten characters are contacted per priest involved in the casting.<br />Increasing the intensity of the message makes it more compelling. Doubling the intensity (requiring at least three priests) causes the message to act as a suggestion. In this case, the effect is limited to a single target. Tripling the intensity (requiring at least five priests) gives the spell the force of a quest. This effect is also limited to a single target. In both cases, the target is allowed a saving throw to avoid the effect of the suggestion or quest.</div>

"description":"This spell allows the caster to temporarily convince himself that certain objects or as many as four creatures within the area of effect do not actually exist. While disbelief remains in effect, these objects or creatures cannot harm or hinder the caster. He can pass through them as if they did not exist and takes no damage from their attacks or actions.
However, since these objects or creatures temporarily do not exist for the priest, he can take no action against them. If the creatures attack, the caster receives no Dexterity bonus to armor class (since this bonus represents dodging, and the priest is unable to dodge a creature that does not exist for him).
The caster can attempt to disbelieve as many as four creatures within 60 feet of his position at the time of casting. He disbelieves the same four creatures for the duration of the spell. Alternatively, the priest can disbelieve any or all inanimate objects of up to 20- cubic-yard volume (thus, he may disbelieve a 12 foot by 15 foot area of 3-foot-thick wall). This volume must be centered on a point no more than 20 yards from the caster.
These two options are mutually exclusive; the priest can disbelieve only creatures or objects, not a combination of both.
Disbelieving a creature includes all gear, equipment, or treasure carried or worn by that creature; it does not include other objects that come into contact with that creature, such as walls, doors, chairs, etc.
Disbelief is not automatic; it requires an extreme effort. To successfully disbelieve, the priest must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation. A successful save means the priest has disbelieved; an unsuccessful check means that the spell has failed and the priest has not convinced himself of the creatures' or objects' non-existence.
While this spell is in effect, the DM must record any damage suffered by the priest from disbelieved creatures. When the spell ends, the caster makes a saving throw vs.
spell. If the saving throw is successful, the priest suffers only one-eighth of any damage inflicted by the creatures (round all fractions down); if the priest fails the saving throw, he suffers one-half of any damage inflicted (round fractions down)."}</textarea>

"description":"The priest casting a mindnet spell establishes a telepathic link with as many as 10 other creatures who may be separated from each other by as much as 10 miles. Thus, a chain of creatures 100 miles long could be established.
The Power granting this spell has the final word on the individuals who may be included in the spell. Most commonly, the spell will be cast to include individuals familiar to the caster. However, depending on the purpose of the spell, the Power may allow a stranger known to the caster only by name to be included in the mindnet.
Unwilling creatures must make a saving throw at a -4 penalty to avoid being included in the mindnet.
Casting the spell requires one round per two creatures in the mindnet. The spell's duration begins after all affected creatures have been linked. Characters of any class may take part in this linkage, benefiting from several effects.
First, each member of the mindnet benefits from Intelligence, Wisdom, and Dexterity bonuses. The bonuses are equal to the bonuses held by the member of the mindnet with the highest ability score. For example, if five creatures in a mindnet have Wisdom scores of 15, 15, 16, 17, and 18, each creature would make saving throws, ability checks, and the like as if he had a Wisdom score of 18. Bonus spells are not gained due to enhanced Wisdom, however.
Second, spells may be pooled among the spellcasters within the mindnet. Any priest may use a spell memorized by another priest with two conditions: the priest who has memorized the spell must allow its use; and a priest \"borrowing\" a spell may use only spells of levels he could normally cast. Such borrowing still causes the spell to be lost from the mind of the caster who memorized it. A caster may not borrow spells outside his normal class restrictions. Priests and wizards within a mindnet cannot mix their priestly and wizardly spells, nor can a specialist borrow a spell from an opposition school.
Third, each member of the mindnet is in constant mental communication. Each member knows what is happening at the locations of all other members.
Finally, twice per turn, the priest casting this spell can instantly teleport any person linked by the mindnet to any other person who is also a part of the spell. This massive effort results in a +4 penalty to any Constitution checks made by the priest.
The priest casting the spell cannot perform any other actions while the mindnet exists; if he does, the spell is canceled. The priest must make a Constitution check at the end of each turn in order to sustain the spell. A failed check cancels the mindnet. The spell can last a maximum of 12 turns."}</textarea>
