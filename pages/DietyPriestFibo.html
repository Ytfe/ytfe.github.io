"description":"This spell allows a priest to sense how far a character, creature, object, or area is from a condition of balance -- in other words, the degree to which its alignment is removed from true Neutral. The spell gives no indication of the \"direction\" in which the alignment is removed from true Neutral except under certain conditions which follow. The spell does, however, indicate along which axis or axes of alignment the variation lies.

For example, a priest uses this spell to analyze the balance of a Chaotic Neutral creature. The spell indicates that the creature is removed from Neutral by one grade, and the variation is along the Law/Chaos axis; thus, the creature must be either Chaotic Neutral or Lawful Neutral. If the creature were Chaotic Evil, the spell would indicate that it is removed from balance by two grades, one along each axis; thus, the creature must be Chaotic Evil, Chaotic Good, Lawful Evil, or Lawful Good.

A priest has a 5% chance per level of correctly determining the direction of variation along one randomly chosen axis. This means that a 10th-level priest evaluating the balance of a Chaotic Neutral creature would have a 50% chance of learning that the creature is Chaotic (and hence Chaotic Neutral, since it is only one step away from balance).

Similar to spells such as detect evil, this spell will not yield a result on a hidden trap. If cast on a creature with an intelligence level of \"animal\" or \"non-,\" it will always read true Neutral (i.e., zero steps removed from balance).

The material components are four iron coins which the priest tosses in his hand while concentrating on the spell. The coins are not consumed in the casting."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell enhances the casters movement capabilities in extraplanar settings by attuning him to his new surroundings. While very few 1st-level priests find themselves in this situation, higher level characters often make use of this spell. Astral celerity doubles the characters movement rate on the Astral Plane; normally, characters move at a rate of 30 times their Intelligence score in feet per round, but this spell increases this to 60 feet times their Intelligence score. As an incidental benefit, the caster also attunes himself to the plane much faster and suffers no penalties for missile fire while astral.

While astral celerity is most often used in the astral plane, it also offers a small benefit to ethereal characters, too: their movement rates are increased by 50%, so a character with a movement rate of 12 would enjoy a movement rate of 18 while this spell was in effect. Of course, time and distance have little meaning in the overall scheme of the Astral or Ethereal Planes, but relative speed could be very important in avoiding an unpleasant encounter or escaping from pursuit of some kind."}</textarea>

If successful, the DM reveals to the player the action's chance for success or any modifiers that may be in play.

For instance, if the priest doesn't know that an orc chieftain is actually a polymorphed tanar'ri masquerading as an orc, he may be astonished to learn that the 'orc' has a THAC0 of 7! If the priest fails his calculation check with a roll of 99 or 00, his calculation is wildly skewed in a random fashion.

A command to \"Die!\" causes the creature to fall in a faint or cataleptic state for one round, but thereafter the creature revives and is alive and well.

				<div class="description-content">This spell enables the priest to command another creature with a single word. The command must be uttered in a language understood by the creature. The subject will obey to the best of his/its ability only as long as the command is absolutely clear and unequivocal; thus, a command of &quot;Suicide!&quot; is ignored. A command to &quot;Die!&quot; causes the creature to fall in a faint or cataleptic state for one round, but thereafter the creature revives and is alive and well. Typical commands are back, halt, flee, run, stop, fall, go, leave, surrender, sleep, rest, etc. No command affects a creature for more than one round; undead are not affected at all. Creatures with Intelligence of 13 (high) or more, or those with 6 or more Hit Dice (or experience levels) are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell, adjusted for Wisdom. (Creatures with 13 or higher Intelligence and 6 Hit Dice/levels get only one saving throw!)</div>

"description":"This spell causes a luminous glow within 20 feet of the spell's center. The area of light thus caused is equal in brightness to torchlight. Objects in darkness beyond this sphere can be seen, at best, as vague and shadowy shapes. The spell is centered on a point selected by the caster, and he must have a line of sight or unobstructed path to that point when the spell is cast. Light can spring from air, rock, metal, wood, or almost any similar substance. The effect is immobile unless it is specifically centered on a movable object or mobile creature. If this spell is cast upon a creature, any applicable magic resistance and saving throws must be rolled. Successful resistance negates the spell, while a successful saving throw indicates that the spell is centered immediately behind the creature, rather than upon the creature itself. A light spell centered on the visual organs of a creature blinds it, reducing its attack and saving throw rolls by 4 and worsening its Armor Class by 4. The caster can extinguish the light at any time by uttering a single word. Light spells are not cumulative--multiple castings do not provide a brighter light.
The spell is reversible, causing darkness in the same area and under the same conditions as the light spell, but with half the duration. Magical darkness is equal to that of an unlit interior room--pitch darkness. Any normal light source or magical light source of lesser intensity than full daylight does not function in magical darkness. A darkness spell cast directly against a light spell cancels both, and vice versa."}</textarea>

"description":"When this spell is cast, it creates a magical barrier around the recipient at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has three major effects: First, all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures against the protected creature receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll, and any saving throws caused by such attacks are made by the protected creature with a +2 bonus.
Second, any attempt to exercise mental control over the protected creature (if, for example, it has been charmed by a vampire) or to invade and take over its mind (as by a ghost's magic jar attack) is blocked by this spell. Note that the protection does not prevent a vampire's charm itself, nor end it, but it does prevent the vampire from exercising mental control through the barrier. Likewise, an outside life force is merely kept out, and would not be expelled if in place before the protection was cast.
Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by creatures of an extraplanar or conjured nature (such as aerial servants, elementals, imps, invisible stalkers, salamanders, water weirds, xorn, and others). This causes the natural (body) weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creature to recoil if such attacks require touching the protected creature.
Animals or monsters summoned or conjured by spells or similar magic are likewise hedged from the character. This protection ends if the protected character makes a melee attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.
To complete this spell, the priest uses holy water or burning incense.
This spell can be reversed to become protection from good, with the second and third benefits remaining unchanged.
The material components for the reverse are a circle of unholy water or smoldering dung."}</textarea>

"description":"This is a cooperative magic spell. It requires a minimum of two priests and can accommodate a maximum of ten. Each priest must cast ring of hands on the same round.
At the end of the casting, the priests involved join hands, thus completing the spell. If any priest breaks the circle, the spell immediately ceases. The priests may not move from their locations but are free to speak. They may not cast spells requiring a somatic or material component while the ring is formed.
The ring of hands forms a protective barrier around the priests and everything within their circle. For each priest, assume a five-foot circumference of the circle; thus, three priests would create a circle of 15-foot circumference. For easy calculation, assume that for each priest, the circle can accommodate four persons.
The barrier functions as a protection from evil spell. Attacks by evil creatures suffer a -1 penalty for every priest forming the circle. Saving throws made by the priests or anyone in the circle against attacks from such creatures receive a +1 bonus for every priest in the circle.
Attempts at mental control over protected creatures are blocked. Extraplanar and conjured creatures are unable to touch the priests and those within the circle, although melee attacks against such creatures by those within the ring break the barrier.
Because the priests casting the spell cannot move and must hold hands, they do not receive any Dexterity bonuses to Armor Class. Furthermore, opponents gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against the priests, since there is little they can do to avoid a blow.
Creatures within the ring are free to act as they wish. Melee attacks by those within the ring are limited to piercing weapons and suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls since the priests intervene.
The reverse of this spell, ring of woe, functions as detailed above except the effect applies to good creatures as would a protection from good spell."}</textarea>

"description":"One of the more bizarre contentions held by priests of the School of Thought is generally scoffed at by outsiders. The theory states that once a thought has occurred in someone's brain, it exists as a \"freestanding mental object.\" This \"thought object\" usually remains inside the brain of the creature that created it, but sometimes it escapes (this supposedly explains why people forget things). When this happens, the thought object stays in the geographical area where it was lost. Any receptive brain (usually the brain of the creature that initially created the thought) can pick it up again simply by bumping into the invisible, free-floating thought. According to the theory, this is the reason that people can regain a lost thought by going back to the location where the thought was lost. This supposedly works because the free-floating thought is recaptured, not because the locale reminds them of the thought. Unfortunately for philosophers who disagree with this, thought capture seems to be extremely strong evidence for this theory.
This spell makes the priest's brain something of a magnet that attracts thought objects in close proximity. The priest can sense strong thoughts and emotions and can sometimes even see momentary visions of creatures who died or suffered some powerful emotion in the immediate vicinity. Thought objects are always attracted to the priest in the order of the strongest (those attached to powerful emotions or significant events) to the weakest.
Thus, if several thought objects share the same vicinity, the priest will perceive information about the most interesting or significant event. The priest might pick up images of a battle from the point of view of a warrior who died there, or he might gain information about the victor of the battle.
The DM dictates the information provided to the priest, and thus can use this spell to provide players with important background information or can add texture to a campaign world. The information provided might be highly cryptic or symbolic, perhaps in the form of a rhyme or riddle.
The priest gains one thought object per casting of the spell. The spell may be cast a number of times in the same locale, with the priest gaining a different thought object with each casting. A locale contains a finite number of thoughts, however, and once the priest has gained all of them (per the DM), the spell will fail in that locale."}</textarea>

"description":"The recipient of this spell gains the benefit of a bless spell (+1 to attack rolls and saving throws) and a special bonus of 1d8 additional hit points for the duration of the spell. The aid spell enables the recipient to actually have more hit points than his full normal total. The bonus hit points are lost first when the recipient takes damage; they cannot be regained by curative magic.
For example, a 1st-level fighter has 8 hit points, suffers 2 points of damage (8-2 = 6), and then receives an aid spell that gives 5 additional hit points. The fighter now has 11 hit points, 5 of which are temporary. If he is then hit for 7 points of damage, 2 normal hit points and all 5 temporary hit points are lost. He then receives a cure light wounds spell that heals 4 points of damage, restoring him to his original 8 hit points.
Note that the operation of the spell is unaffected by permanent hit point losses due to energy drain, Hit Die losses, the loss of a familiar, or the operation of certain artifacts; the temporary hit point gain is figured from the new, lower total.
The material components of this spell are a tiny strip of white cloth with a sticky substance (such as tree sap) on the ends, plus the priest's holy symbol."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">The recipient of this spell gains the benefit of a bless spell (+1 to attack rolls and saving throws) and a special bonus of 1d8 additional hit points for the duration of the spell. The aid spell enables the recipient to actually have more hit points than his full normal total. The bonus hit points are lost first when the recipient takes damage; they cannot be regained by curative magic.<br />For example, a 1st-level fighter has 8 hit points, suffers 2 points of damage (8-2 = 6), and then receives an aid spell that gives 5 additional hit points. The fighter now has 11 hit points, 5 of which are temporary. If he is then hit for 7 points of damage, 2 normal hit points and all 5 temporary hit points are lost. He then receives a cure light wounds spell that heals 4 points of damage, restoring him to his original 8 hit points.<br />Note that the operation of the spell is unaffected by permanent hit point losses due to energy drain, Hit Die losses, the loss of a familiar, or the operation of certain artifacts; the temporary hit point gain is figured from the new, lower total.<br />The material components of this spell are a tiny strip of white cloth with a sticky substance (such as tree sap) on the ends, plus the priest&#039;s holy symbol.</div>

"description":"This spell temporarily calms a chaotic situation involving a group of people. The situation may involve any range of emotions from violence (as in a barroom brawl) to joy and merrymaking (as in a festival or carnival).
Unlike the emotion spell, calm chaos does not cause a change in the emotions of affected creatures--anger, fear, or intense joy remain in each individual. The emotion is simply restrained rather than released. Thus, an angry character intent on attacking someone will still feel the desire to do so, but he will withhold his action as long as the spell remains in effect.
Creatures to be affected are allowed a saving throw vs. spell at a -4 penalty to avoid the effects. If more creatures are present than can be affected, creatures nearest the caster are affected first.
After casting the spell, the priest makes a Charisma check. If successful, all characters affected by the spell are compelled to stop what they are doing. They are filled with the sensation that something important is about to occur. At this time, the priest or a character of his choosing must gain the attention of the affected creatures by giving a speech, performing for the crowd, or casting spells with intriguing visual effects (such as dancing lights). The attention of the crowd is then held for as long as the distraction continues. A character could filibuster and maintain control over the affected characters for hours or days.
Two conditions will cause the group to resume its original actions. In the first, the method of entertaining the crowd ceases for one round--the speech ends or the spell expires. If this action is not replaced with another distraction within one round, the crowd is freed of the spell.
In the second condition, if an event occurs that is more immediate than the distraction, the crowd will divert its attention to that event. Thus, if the spell were used to stop a barroom brawl and the building caught fire or was attacked, the crowd's attention would be diverted and the individuals could act freely.
Creatures whose attention is held by the spell cannot be instructed to attack or perform any action. Such creatures will ignore suggestions of this nature. Depending on the nature of the request, the DM may deem that the suggestion causes a distraction that ends the spell."}</textarea>

"description":"A priest using this spell can enthrall an audience that can fully understand his language. Those in the area of effect must successfully save vs. spell or give the caster their undivided attention, totally ignoring their surroundings. Those of a race or religion unfriendly to the caster's have a +4 bonus to the roll. Any Wisdom adjustment also applies. Creatures with 4 or more levels or Hit Dice, or with a Wisdom of 16 or better, are unaffected.
To cast the spell, the caster must speak without interruption for a full round.
Thereafter, the enchantment lasts as long as the priest speaks, to a maximum of one hour.
Those enthralled take no action while the priest speaks, and for 1d3 rounds thereafter while they discuss the matter. Those entering the area of effect must also successfully save vs. spell or become enthralled. Those not enthralled are 50% likely every turn to hoot and jeer in unison. If there is excessive jeering, the rest are allowed a new saving throw. The speech ends (but the 1d3 round delay still applies) if the priest is successfully attacked or performs any action other than speaking.
If the audience is attacked, the spell ends and the audience reacts immediately, rolling a reaction check with respect to the source of the interruption, at a penalty of -10.
Note: When handling a large number of saving throws for similar creatures, the DM can assume an average to save time; for example, a crowd of 20 men with a base saving throw of 16 (25% success chance) will have 15 men enthralled and five not."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">A priest using this spell can enthrall an audience that can fully understand his language. Those in the area of effect must successfully save vs. spell or give the caster their undivided attention, totally ignoring their surroundings. Those of a race or religion unfriendly to the caster&#039;s have a +4 bonus to the roll. Any Wisdom adjustment also applies. Creatures with 4 or more levels or Hit Dice, or with a Wisdom of 16 or better, are unaffected.<br />To cast the spell, the caster must speak without interruption for a full round.<br />Thereafter, the enchantment lasts as long as the priest speaks, to a maximum of one hour.<br />Those enthralled take no action while the priest speaks, and for 1d3 rounds thereafter while they discuss the matter. Those entering the area of effect must also successfully save vs. spell or become enthralled. Those not enthralled are 50% likely every turn to hoot and jeer in unison. If there is excessive jeering, the rest are allowed a new saving throw. The speech ends (but the 1d3 round delay still applies) if the priest is successfully attacked or performs any action other than speaking.<br />If the audience is attacked, the spell ends and the audience reacts immediately, rolling a reaction check with respect to the source of the interruption, at a penalty of -10.<br />Note: When handling a large number of saving throws for similar creatures, the DM can assume an average to save time; for example, a crowd of 20 men with a base saving throw of 16 (25% success chance) will have 15 men enthralled and five not.</div>

"description":"The ethereal barrier is a defense against the passage of extradimensional creatures, including characters or monsters that are phased, ethereal, or travelling via dimension door or shadow walk. The priest creates an imperceptible barrier of 10 square feet per level that may be arranged in any fashion the priest desires. For example, a 3rd-level character can ward six 10-foot by 10-foot surfaces, which would be sufficient to guard a 10-foot by 10-foot by 10-foot room (four walls, a ceiling, and a floor need to be protected.) Note that some monsters may be capable of abandoning their ethereal approach in order to simply enter the barred area on their own feet-the ethereal barrier only bars their passage as long as they are traveling in the Border Ethereal. Also, while this spell can't be worn down by any form of attack, it does not bar teleportation, gates, or the passage of astral creatures.
Ethereal barrier may be cast as cooperative magic by several priests working together. As long as all involved characters can cast the spell, the areas of effect of each priest are added together. Total the levels of all priests involved and multiply by two to find the number of 10-foot by 10-foot squares that may be warded. For example, four 6th-level casters (24 total levels) can ward 48 10-foot by 10-foot squares. The duration is determined by the highest level priest involved, plus 1 turn for each additional priest. In the previous example, this would be 6 turns plus 3 turns for three additional priests for a total of 9 turns.
This spell is also suitable for focus magic (see the spell focus in the Tome of Magic). The material component is a special compound of rare earths and lead worth at least 10 gp per application. One application is required for each 10-foot by 10-foot square to be warded."}</textarea>

"description":"With this spell, the caster can enchant a chest, book, or any other nonliving object no larger than a 10'x10'x10' cube. When any creature other than the caster comes within three feet of the enchanted object, it instantly sprouts appendages and moves away from the creature as quickly as possible. The enchanted object continues to move until it is at least 10 feet away from the nearest creatures in the area.
After the enchanted object has moved a satisfactory distance from the nearest creature, the appendages disappear. When a creature again comes within three feet of the enchanted object, the enchanted object sprouts appendages and flees. This process continues until the enchantment is negated (through a dispel magic or similar spell) or the enchanted object is subdued or destroyed.
The enchanted object can sprout feet (MV 24), wings (Fl 24, maneuverability class B), or fins (Sw 24), whichever is most advantageous. Thus, a book on a shelf might sprout wings and fly away, while a table might gallop around a room. The enchanted object can freely and instantly trade appendages as necessary.
The enchanted object will move only through open spaces. It will not crash through windows, shatter a closed door, or dig through the earth. It cannot attack or take any actions other than movement. If surrounded or cornered, the enchanted object moves in random directions until it is restrained or destroyed.
The enchantment ends if the caster voluntarily negates it, if the enchanted object is destroyed (the object has the same vulnerabilities as it has in its normal state), or if the enchanted object is restrained for 2-5 (1d4+1) consecutive rounds. Restraint means that the object is prevented from fleeing; if a creature is able to grapple, lift, or sit on the object, it is considered restrained. A creature capable of lifting the object in its normal state is considered strong enough to restrain it (for instance, a person capable of lifting a 50-pound box is also capable of restraining such a box enchanted by frisky chest). The object may also be restrained by tossing a net or heavy blanket over it or by surrounding it with several characters.
The material components are a dried frog's leg, a feather, and a fish scale."}</textarea>

Elven chain mail is not affected, and magical metal armor receives an item saving throw vs. magical fire to avoid being heated. The material component is a holy symbol.
On the first round of the spell, the metal merely becomes very warm and uncomfortable to touch (this is also the effect on the last melee round of the spell's duration). During the second and sixth (next to the last) rounds, heat causes blisters and damage; in the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal becomes searing hot, causing damage to exposed flesh, as shown below: Metal Temperature Damage per Round very warm none hot 1d4 points searing* 2d4 points * On the final round of searing, the afflicted creature must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or suffer one of the following disabilities: hand or foot--becomes unusable for 2d4 days; body--becomes disabled for 1d4 days; head--fall unconscious for 1d4 turns.
This effect can be completely removed by the 6th-level priest spell heal spell or by normal rest.
Note also that materials such as wood, leather, or flammable cloth smolder and burn if exposed to searing hot metal. Such materials cause searing damage to exposed flesh on the next round. Fire resistance (spell, potion, or ring) or a protection from fire spell totally negates the effects of a heat metal spell, as does immersion in water or snow, or exposure to a cold or ice storm spell. This version of the spell does not function under water. For every two experience levels of the caster, the metal of one man-sized creature can be affected (i.e., arms and armor, or a single mass of metal equal to 50 pounds of weight).
Thus, a 3rd-level caster would affect one such creature, a 4th- or 5th-level caster two, etc.
The reverse of the spell, chill metal, counters a heat metal spell or else causes metal to act as follows: Metal Temperature Damage per Round cold none icy 1-2 points freezing* 1d4 points * On the final round of freezing, the afflicted creature must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or suffer from the numbing effects of the cold. This causes the loss of all feeling in a hand (or hands, if the DM rules the saving throw was failed badly) for 1d4 days. During this time, the character's grip is extremely weak and he cannot use that hand for fighting or any other activity requiring a firm grasp.
The chill metal spell is countered by a resist cold spell, or by any great heat--proximity to a blazing fire (not a mere torch), a magical flaming sword, a wall of fire spell, etc.
Under water, this version of the spell inflicts no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, exerting an upward buoyancy."}</textarea>

The hold person spell affects any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man size or smaller, including brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, halfelves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others.

The effect is centered on a point selected by the caster, and it affects persons selected by the caster within the area of effect.

Saving throws are adjusted for Wisdom. Those who succeed on their saving throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.
Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison. The priest casting the hold person spell can end the spell with a single utterance at any time; otherwise, the duration is six rounds at 3rd level, eight rounds at 4th level, etc.
The spellcaster needs a small, straight piece of iron as the material component of this spell."}</textarea>

"description":"Theoretically, every action has a particular moment at which it will have its greatest possible effect. Using the arcane mathematics of this spell, the priest can determine the \"ideal moment\" for any single action in each round that the spell is in effect. This action must be performed by a character other than the priest.
In practice, another character informs the priest of an action he wants to undertake in a round. The priest concentrates on the action, then informs the character when the \"correct moment\" has come. The character then gains a bonus of 20% (+4 on a d20) to the success of his action. The spell can affect only a single action in a given round. When used in combat, the priest can advise the best moment to initiate an action (affecting initiative) or what moment offers the greatest success in striking (affecting the chance to hit).
If the character seeks advice concerning initiative, he gains a -2 modifier to the initiative roll, but only at the cost of -2 on his chance to hit. Characters who seek the best attack frequently delay their actions. These characters suffer a +1 on their initiative roll but gain a +4 on their chance to hit. The spell cannot affect the amount of damage caused, since the act (striking) has already succeeded at that point.
Characters are not obliged to wait for the moment specified by the priest. For example, a fighter might decide that striking first is more important than gaining +4 to hit. The character can act normally, based on his or her unmodified initiative. The character gains no bonus from the moment spell, and the priest can affect no other action in that round.
Noncombat actions can also benefit from the moment spell. For example, a thief planning to climb a wall may wait to start her climb until the priest informs her that the moment is right. If she waits, she gains a bonus of 20% to her Climb Walls roll (in this case, the bonus is subtracted from her roll).
While concentrating on this spell, the priest can take no other action. A break in the priest's concentration--taking damage in combat, for example--terminates the spell instantly.

"description":"This spell is one of the few cooperative spells that requires one priest to cast the transfer spell, but another priest to use its effect. On one round, a priest (or priests) casts the mystic transfer. The spell is then active for the remaining nine rounds of the turn.
Mystic transfer allows a priest to receive spells from another priest of the same ethos.
Any priest of the same religion can cast a spell and transfer it to a second priest within that spell's maximum range. The spell does not take effect; instead, it is channelled through the mystic transfer into the receiving priest. This priest must immediately cast the spell or pass it to another priest cloaked in a mystic transfer within the spell's range. Any number of transfers can be made in the same round, provided each new recipient is within spell range of the previous recipient. If the spell is not transferred, the spell takes effect.
For example, a 3rd-level priest casts a mystic transfer. On the following round, a 10th-level priest \"passes\" a flame strike to the 3rd-level priest. The two priests could be 60 yards apart (the maximum range of the flame strike). The 3rd-level priest could then use the flame strike to attack any target within 60 yards, or could pass the spell on to another priest who has an active mystic transfer.
The spell passed by the mystic transfer has the range, area of effect, damage, and other effects equal to the level of the original caster. In the example above, the flame strike would function as if cast by a 10th-level priest.
The mystic transfer does not require concentration. However, on any round in which a priest is receiving and/or transferring a spell, the caster cannot take any other significant action.
A priest can receive spells only from priests who worship the same deity and who specifically target spells to him. Area effect spells may be passed. A priest can never use mystic transfer to pluck an opponent's spells out of the air."}</textarea>

"description":"This cooperative spell allows the priests to create a beneficial atmosphere within a specified area. Companions of similar alignment to the casters will feel fortified and encouraged while in the sanctified area. The spell can be cast by a single priest or a group of priests.
After casting sanctify, the affected area is imbued with the deity's majesty. For followers of that deity, the area radiates a holy aura. These followers gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against all fear- and charm-based powers (a +2 to morale for BATTLESYSTEM rules units). Persons of the same alignment as the caster but of different faiths gain a +1 to saving throws (+1 in BATTLESYSTEM rules). The effect applies only as long as the characters remain in the sanctified area.
Creatures intent on harming the priest or his followers suffer a -1 on saving throws vs.
fear and charm (-1 to morale for BATTLESYSTEM rules units) when on sanctified ground.
Undead creatures within the area are easier to turn; any priest standing on sanctified ground turns undead as if he were one level higher.
Although this spell can be cast by a single priest, it is most effective when cast by several priests at once. The duration of the spell is equal to one round per level of the caster. When several priests cast the spell, the level of the most powerful priest is used, with two rounds added for every contributing priest. Thus, one 8th-level and three 6thlevel priests would give the spell a duration of 14 rounds (8+2+2+2).
Sanctify is often used in conjunction with focus to protect the grounds of a temple or encourage men defending a castle.
The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a handful of dirt from the grounds of an existing temple of the same faith.
The reverse of this spell, defile, functions in an identical manner with respect to saving throws for charm and fear. However, priests standing on defiled ground who attempt to turn undead do so at one level lower than their current level.
The material components for the reverse are the priest's holy symbol and a handful of earth from a grave."}</textarea>

"description":"When this spell is cast, all natural, undressed earth or stone in the area of effect is softened. Wet earth becomes thick mud; dry earth becomes loose sand or dirt; and stone becomes soft clay, easily molded or chopped. The priest affects a 10-foot square area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the toughness or resilience of the ground at that spot (DM option). Magical or enchanted stone cannot be affected by this spell, nor can dressed or worked stone.
Creatures attempting to move through an area softened into mud are reduced to a move of 10 feet per round. Any creatures caught within the mud when the spell takes effect must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation or lose the ability to move, attack, or cast spells for 1d2 rounds as they flounder about in the muck. Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, and creatures are only reduced to half their normal movement rate, with no chance of being caught for a round or two. However, it is impossible to run, sprint, or charge over either surface.
Restore Strength Soften Earth and Stone Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before. For example, a party of PCs trying to break out of a cavern might use this spell to soften a wall.
While soften earth and stone does not affect dressed or worked stone, vertical surfaces such as cliff faces or cavern ceilings can be affected. Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face or roof and falls. A moderate amount of structural damage can be inflicted to man-made structures by softening the ground beneath a wall or tower, causing it to settle. However, most well-built structures will only be damaged by this spell, not destroyed. The material component is a bit of slip (wet clay) from the wheel of a master potter."}</textarea>

However, it is impossible to run, sprint, or charge over either surface.<br />Restore Strength Soften Earth and Stone Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before. For example, a party of PCs trying to break out of a cavern might use this spell to soften a wall.<br />While soften earth and stone does not affect dressed or worked stone, vertical surfaces such as cliff faces or cavern ceilings can be affected. Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face or roof and falls. A moderate amount of structural damage can be inflicted to man-made structures by softening the ground beneath a wall or tower, causing it to settle. However, most well-built structures will only be damaged by this spell, not destroyed. The material component is a bit of slip (wet clay) from the wheel of a master potter.</div>

"description":"By calling upon his deity, the caster of a spiritual hammer spell brings into existence a field of force shaped vaguely like a hammer. As long as the caster concentrates upon the hammer, it strikes at any opponent within its range, as desired. Each round the caster can choose to attack the same target as the previous round or switch to a new target that he can see anywhere within his maximum range. The spiritual hammer's chance to successfully hit is equal to that of the caster, without any Strength bonuses. In addition, it strikes as a magical weapon with a bonus of +1 for every six experience levels (or fraction) of the spellcaster, up to a total of +3 to the attack roll and +3 to the damage roll for a 13th-level caster. The base damage inflicted when it scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal war hammer (1d4+1 points on opponents of man size or smaller, or 1d4 points on larger opponents, plus the magical bonus). The hammer strikes in the same direction as the caster is facing, so if he is behind the target, all bonuses for rear attack are gained along with the loss of any modifications to the target's AC for shield and Dexterity.
As soon as the caster ceases concentration, the spiritual hammer spell ends. A dispel magic spell that includes either the caster or the force in its area of effect has a chance to dispel the spiritual hammer. If an attacked creature has magic resistance, the resistance is checked the first time the spiritual hammer strikes. If the hammer is successfully resisted, the spell is lost. If not, the hammer has its normal full effect for the duration of the spell.
The material component of this spell is a normal war hammer that the priest must hurl toward opponents while uttering a plea to his deity. The hammer disappears when the spell is cast."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell conjures a coherent pseudopod of water from any suitable body of water at least 5 feet across and 2 feet deep (for streams) or 10 feet in diameter and 2 feet deep (for ponds or pools). The pseudopod can stretch up to 10 feet plus 1 foot per caster level from its source, so a 3rd-level priest could command watery fist to strike at a creature hovering thirteen feet above a lake or standing on the shore 13 feet from the water. The pseudopod obeys the priest's mental commands, although the priest must concentrate each round in order to maintain control of the watery member.
The pseudopod is incapable of fine manipulation, but it can be used to make bludgeoning or constricting attacks. When used to strike at opponents, it attacks with the caster's THAC0 and inflicts damage as shown below. The priest may add his magical attack adjustment (from his Wisdom score) to his THAC0, but Strength-based adjustments or special weapon skills don't help the priest to control watery fist. The pseudopod may be able to make rear or flank attacks if the priest can direct it into the proper position.
If used to encircle and constrict, the pseudopod must first make an attack roll as described above, inflicting damage based on the priest's level. However, in following rounds, the pseudopod automatically strikes its grappled target for constricting damage, +1 point per round of constricting. In other words, in the first round the victim sustains listed damage, in the second round he sustains listed damage +1, in the third he sustains listed damage +2, and so on. The pseudopod holds its target with an effective Strength equal to the priest's Wisdom score.
Watery fist can be released by the priest any time he cares to stop concentrating on maintaining it. The pseudopod immediately resumes its normal state, possibly drenching a grappled creature or extinguishing a small fire if the caster wishes. The pseudopod is AC 6 and has 15 hp plus 1 hp per caster level, but it can only be damaged by magical weapons, fire, or cold; all other attacks simply pass through the water.
Transmute water to dust, part water, lower water, and Otiluke's freezing sphere all destroy watery fist on contact.
The material component is a vial full of blessed water or a sprig of mistletoe that is thrown onto the body of water from which the fist will be summoned."}</textarea>

Any creature within a 10-foot radius of the path or the point where the lightning strikes suffers full damage unless a successful saving throw vs. spell is rolled, in which case only one-half damage is taken.<br />Because it requires a storm overhead, this spell can only be used outdoors. It does not function under ground or under water.</div>

"description":"This spell is similar to a light spell, except that it is as bright as full daylight and lasts until negated by magical darkness or by a dispel magic spell. Creatures with penalties in bright light suffer them in this spell's area of effect. As with the light spell, this can be cast into the air, onto an object, or at a creature. In the third case, the continual light affects the space about 1 foot behind a creature that successfully rolls its saving throw vs.
spell (a failed saving throw means the continual light is centered on the creature and moves as it moves). Note that this spell also blinds a creature if it is successfully cast upon the creature's visual organs. If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed in a light-proof covering, the spell effects are blocked until the covering is removed.
Continual light brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) cancels the darkness so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. A direct casting of a continual light spell against a similar or weaker magical darkness cancels both.
This spell eventually consumes the material it is cast upon, but the process takes far longer than the time in a typical campaign. Extremely hard and expensive materials might last hundreds or even thousands of years.
The reverse spell, continual darkness, causes complete absence of light (pitch blackness), similar to the darkness spell but of greater duration and area."}</textarea>

"description":"With this spell, the caster generates a squadron of tiny invisible servants who create a campsite for the caster and his companions. The caster indicates the desired area for the campsite (an area of 50-foot radius or less) and the number of persons the campsite is to accommodate (a number of persons equal to three times the level of the caster).
The servants clear the area of debris, set up tents and bedrolls, start a campfire, fetch water, and prepare a bland meal. The campsite is so skillfully prepared that it blends with the surrounding terrain, reducing the chance that the camp could be noticed by 50%.
Campfires, loud noises, and other activities can negate this.
The entire process takes 4-16 (4d4) rounds to complete.
The servants make camp with the gear and equipment provided for them; otherwise, the servants will improvise with materials available in the immediate area (50 yards of the designated campsite). For instance, if the party has no tents or beds, the servants will construct crude but comfortable beds of weeds and grass and temporary shelters of leaves and branches. If no materials are available, such as in the desert or similarly barren terrain, the servants will do their best to make the party as comfortable as possible within the environmental limitations.
The servants cannot fight for the party, deliver messages, or take any other actions other than creating the campsite.
The material components are a piece of string, a bit of wood, and a drop of water.
The reverse, break camp, causes the invisible servants to strike a campsite (an area of 50-foot radius or less). The servants extinguish fires, dispose of debris, and pack gear for a number of people equal to three times the level of the caster. The entire process takes 4- 16 (4d4) rounds to complete. When completed, all traces of the campsite are eliminated.

The dictate spell is an improved version of command, affecting up to 6 creatures in a 20-foot cube. The caster is not limited to a single word and can issue an order of no more than a dozen words in length. All the specified targets who fail their saving throws must attempt to obey the caster's instructions.

Subjects who cannot understand the caster are not affected, so characters who do not understand the caster's language are immune to this spell. In addition, the order must Detect Spirits Dictate create an immediate and obvious course of action for the subject; a dictate to \"Die!\" or \"Feel sorry for him!\" would simply cause the subject to stand still in confusion for one round.

"description":"When a priest casts this spell, it has a chance to neutralize or negate the magic it comes in contact with as follows: First, it has a chance to remove spells and spell-like effects (including device effects and innate abilities) from creatures or objects. Second, it may disrupt the casting or use of these in the area of effect at the instant the dispel is cast. Third, it may destroy magical potions (which are treated as 12th level for purposes of this spell).
Each effect or potion in the spell's area is checked to determine if it is dispelled. The caster can always dispel his own magic; otherwise, the chance depends on the difference in level between the magical effect and the caster. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 11 or higher on 1d20. If the caster is of higher level than the creator of the effect to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted from this base number needed. If the caster is of lower level, the difference is added to the base. A die roll of 20 always succeeds and a die roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic he is trying to dispel, only a roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dispelled.
A dispel magic can affect only a specially enchanted item (such as a magical scroll, ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous item, weapon, shield, or armor) if it is cast directly upon the item. This renders the item nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An item possessed or carried by a creature has the creature's saving throw against this effect; otherwise, it is automatically rendered nonoperational. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) rendered nonoperational is temporarily closed. Note that an item's physical properties are unchanged: A nonoperational magical sword is still a sword.
Artifacts and relics are not subject to this spell, but some of their spell-like effects may be, at the DM's option.
Note that this spell, if successful, will release charmed and similarly beguiled creatures. Certain spells or effects cannot be dispelled; these are listed in the spell descriptions.

"description":"This spell can be cast in one of two ways: in a manner that affects the priest, or in a manner that affects a subject other than the priest.
The first method affects only the priest and allows him to shield his true emotions from magical examination. Thus, it can block wizard spells such as ESP or priest spells such as emotion read. While emotion control is in effect, anyone using one of these spells will sense the emotion designated by the priest rather than his true emotions. When the priest casts emotion control, he designates the false emotion he wishes to be revealed.
This use of emotion control also gives the priest a +2 bonus to saving throws against the following spells: spook, taunt, irritation, know alignment, scare, emotion, fear, and phantasmal killer. When any of these spells are cast on the priest, he is immediately aware of the attempt, although he does not learn the source of the spell.
If another character casts emotion read, ESP, or a similar spell on the priest, the priest must make a saving throw vs. spells with a +1 bonus for each 5 levels of the priest. If the priest successfully saves, the other spellcaster reads the false emotion; if the priest fails the saving throw, the spellcaster reads the priest's true emotion.
The second use of this spell allows the priest to create a single emotional reaction in the subject(s) (similar to the wizard spell emotion). Some typical emotions follow, but the DM may allow other similar effects.
Courage: The subject becomes berserk, gaining +1 to attack rolls and +3 to damage, and temporarily gaining 4 hit points (damage against the subject is deducted from these temporary points first). The subject need never check morale, and receives a +5 bonus to saving throws against the various forms of fear. Courage counters (and is countered by) fear.
Fear: The subject flees from the priest for the duration of the spell, even if this takes him out of spell range. Fear counters (and is countered by) courage.
Friendship: The subject reacts positively to any encounter; in game terms, any result of a roll on the Encounter Reactions table (Table 59 in the DMG ) is moved one column to the left. Thus, a threatening PC becomes cautious, an indifferent PC becomes friendly, etc. Friendship counters (and is countered by) hate.
Happiness: The subject experiences feelings of warmth, well-being, and confidence, modifying all reaction rolls by +3. The subject is unlikely to attack unless provoked.
Happiness counters (and is countered by) sadness.
Hate: The subject reacts negatively to any encounter; in game terms, any result of a roll on the Encounter Reactions table is moved one column to the right (i.e., a friendly PC becomes indifferent, a cautious PC becomes threatening, etc.). Hate counters (and is countered by) friendship.
Hope: The subject's morale is improved by +2. His saving throw rolls, attack, and damage rolls are all improved by +1 while this emotion is in effect. Hope counters (and is countered by) hopelessness.
Hopelessness: The subject's morale suffers a -10 penalty. In addition, in the round in which the emotion is initially established, all subjects must immediately make a morale check. Hopelessness counters (and is countered by) hope.
Sadness: The subject feels uncontrollably glum and is prone to fits of morose introspection. All attack rolls suffer a -1 penalty and initiative rolls suffer a +1 penalty.
The subject's chance of being surprised is increased by -2. Sadness counters (and is countered by) happiness.
All subjects of the second version, even willing targets, must save vs. spell to resist the emotion. In addition to all other modifiers, the saving throw is modified by -1 for every three levels of the priest casting the spell.
The material component for both versions of the spell is a small bunch of fleece or uncarded wool that is consumed in the casting."}</textarea>

Secondly, the priest may not use this spell on an unwilling target and can only make another creature ethereal if the subject is willing and in physical contact with the priest when the spell is cast.

While ethereal, the priest cannot be detected by any means short of a true seeing or detect phase spell. He perceives his surroundings as misty, gray, and otherworldly. No action he takes can affect the physical world, but he can pass through walls, doors, and other solid objects without hindrance.

"description":"All invisible creatures who enter an area enchanted with invisibility purge instantly become visible. Invisibility -related spells do not take effect within the boundaries of the enchanted area, and magical devices such as potions of invisibility do not function.
Creatures with the natural ability to become invisible are unable to use this ability within the area of effect. Invisible objects carried into the warded area also become visible.
Invisible creatures or persons within the area of effect when invisibility purge is cast remain invisible; however, if such creatures exit the area of effect and later re-enter, they instantly become visible. Such creatures also lose any natural ability to turn invisible as long as they remain within the area of effect.
A creature who consumes a potion of invisibility outside the warded area becomes invisible normally, but becomes visible when he enters the area of effect; if the duration of the potion of invisibility has not yet expired when he exits the area of effect, he becomes invisible again outside the area.
Creatures who are invisible in their natural state or have no visible form (such as invisible stalkers) are not affected by this spell.
The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a silver mirror no more than three inches in diameter.
The invisibility purge can be cast as a cooperative magic spell. The potency of this spell can be increased if several priests cast it at the same time. The duration of the spell is then equal to one turn per level of the most powerful priest, plus one turn for every contributing priest. Each priest also increases the area of effect by one 10'x 10' square (these areas must be contiguous). Thus, a 9th-level priest and two 5th-level priests could create a 30'x 10' invisibility purge area having a duration of 11 turns."}</textarea>

Invisible objects carried into the warded area also become visible.<br />Invisible creatures or persons within the area of effect when invisibility purge is cast remain invisible; however, if such creatures exit the area of effect and later re-enter, they instantly become visible. Such creatures also lose any natural ability to turn invisible as long as they remain within the area of effect.<br />A creature who consumes a potion of invisibility outside the warded area becomes invisible normally, but becomes visible when he enters the area of effect; if the duration of the potion of invisibility has not yet expired when he exits the area of effect, he becomes invisible again outside the area.<br />Creatures who are invisible in their natural state or have no visible form (such as invisible stalkers) are not affected by this spell.<br />The material components are the priest&#039;s holy symbol and a silver mirror no more than three inches in diameter.<br />The invisibility purge can be cast as a cooperative magic spell. The potency of this spell can be increased if several priests cast it at the same time. The duration of the spell is then equal to one turn per level of the most powerful priest, plus one turn for every contributing priest. Each priest also increases the area of effect by one 10&#039;x 10&#039; square (these areas must be contiguous). Thus, a 9th-level priest and two 5th-level priests could create a 30&#039;x 10&#039; invisibility purge area having a duration of 11 turns.</div>

"description":"This cooperative spell requires at least two priests to cast the spell simultaneously.
During the casting, the priests determine whether the line will be stationary or portable.
If the spell is stationary, each priest must inscribe a magical sigil on parallel facing surfaces, such as facing walls of a gatehouse or two tree trunks. If the spell is portable, the priests must stand at each end of the line, thereby anchoring it.
After the spell is cast, a shimmering field of force appears between the two anchors (the sigils or priests). The field is 10 feet high and sparkles with energy. Objects on the opposite side of the translucent field, while recognizable, are hazy and indistinct.
The field causes 1d3 points of damage to all creatures passing through it; evil creatures and undead suffer 1d8 points of damage from the field. Creatures that roll a successful saving throw suffer no damage. Creatures that can fly over the field, burrow under it, or teleport to the other side are immune to damage.
If the spell is cast in its portable form, the priests can move at half their movement rates (limited to the rate of the slower priest). The priests can take no other action, since all their energy is spent in walking and maintaining the field.
Once created, the field cannot be increased or decreased in length and must remain straight. The priests could maneuver by pivoting, but could not walk toward each other or bend the field around a corner. If the line of sight between the two priests is blocked by any object of greater than 5' diameter, the spell immediately fails. Thus, creatures, low walls, young trees, pillars, and similar objects will not disrupt the spell.
As a cooperative spell, several priests can link together to create a longer field. Each priest (or sigil) forms the end of one field and the beginning of another, much like fenceposts. Each section of the spell must extend in a straight line, but the field can be bent at each junction. Four priests could form a long line, a square, or a Z pattern. The restrictions on moving the fields apply as outlined above. The DM may apply movement penalties depending on the complexity of the pattern.
The material components are the priests' croziers, staves, or religious standards, held aloft by each caster.
The reverse of this spell, line of destruction, causes 1d3 damage to all creatures passing through it. It causes 1d8 damage to paladins and creatures of good alignment who pass through it. Creatures that roll a successful saving throw suffer no damage."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell allows the priest to determine the \"tenor of the now\"--in other words, to learn the \"force\" that is most dominant at the time. To cast the spell, the priest generates a series of random numbers and then studies the pattern contained in that string of numbers. This pattern contains information about current conditions.
In game terms, when this spell is cast, the DM communicates to the priest's player a single word or short phrase (no more than five words) describing the \"tone\" of the situation. Examples of suitable \"tones\" are \"imminent danger\" (the DM knows a dragon is approaching the area); \"peace and tranquility\" (the woods in which the PCS camp may look threatening, but the area is actually free of evil influence); or \"betrayal\" (one of the PCS' hirelings is actually a spy of their enemy). The DM can make this comment cryptic, but it should always be accurate and contain some useful information.
This spell has no specified area of effect. The result of moment reading will always concern the priest and anyone else in his immediate vicinity, but the definition of \"vicinity\" will vary depending on the circumstances. For example, the tenor of the moment might be \"severe danger\" if the priest is entering the territory of a dragon who attacks interlopers on sight.
The tenor of the moment is always personally applicable to the priest. For example, even if the priest is in a nation dangerously close to war with its neighbor, this condition will not appear in the tenor of the moment unless the priest is personally involved (if he's currently in the direct path of an invading army, for instance).
One casting of this spell tends to \"taint\" subsequent castings of the same spell unless they are separated by a minimum length of time. If a priest casts this spell twice within 12 hours, the second reading gives the same result as the first, regardless of the actual situation. If a second priest casts the spell within 12 hours of another priest's use of the spell, he receives an accurate reading.
The material component is a set of 36 small disks made of polished bone engraved with runes that represent numbers. These disks are not consumed in the casting."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">This spell allows the priest to determine the &quot;tenor of the now&quot;--in other words, to learn the &quot;force&quot; that is most dominant at the time. To cast the spell, the priest generates a series of random numbers and then studies the pattern contained in that string of numbers. This pattern contains information about current conditions.<br />In game terms, when this spell is cast, the DM communicates to the priest&#039;s player a single word or short phrase (no more than five words) describing the &quot;tone&quot; of the situation. Examples of suitable &quot;tones&quot; are &quot;imminent danger&quot; (the DM knows a dragon is approaching the area); &quot;peace and tranquility&quot; (the woods in which the PCS camp may look threatening, but the area is actually free of evil influence); or &quot;betrayal&quot; (one of the PCS&#039; hirelings is actually a spy of their enemy). The DM can make this comment cryptic, but it should always be accurate and contain some useful information.<br />This spell has no specified area of effect. The result of moment reading will always concern the priest and anyone else in his immediate vicinity, but the definition of &quot;vicinity&quot; will vary depending on the circumstances. For example, the tenor of the moment might be &quot;severe danger&quot; if the priest is entering the territory of a dragon who attacks interlopers on sight.<br />The tenor of the moment is always personally applicable to the priest. For example, even if the priest is in a nation dangerously close to war with its neighbor, this condition will not appear in the tenor of the moment unless the priest is personally involved (if he&#039;s currently in the direct path of an invading army, for instance).<br />One casting of this spell tends to &quot;taint&quot; subsequent castings of the same spell unless they are separated by a minimum length of time. If a priest casts this spell twice within 12 hours, the second reading gives the same result as the first, regardless of the actual situation. If a second priest casts the spell within 12 hours of another priest&#039;s use of the spell, he receives an accurate reading.<br />The material component is a set of 36 small disks made of polished bone engraved with runes that represent numbers. These disks are not consumed in the casting.</div>

An attacking undead creature suffers 2d6 points of damage from the positive energy; a draining wizard or weapon receives no damage.
This protection is proof against only one such attack, dissipating immediately whether or not the saving throw was successful.

"description":"Upon casting this spell, the priest is usually able to remove a curse on an object, on a person, or in the form of some undesired sending or evil presence. Note that the remove curse spell does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, for example, although the spell typically enables the person afflicted with any such cursed item to get rid of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell, or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or more. A caster of 12th level or more can cure lycanthropy with this spell by casting it on the animal form. The were-creature receives a saving throw vs. spell and, if successful, the spell fails and the priest must gain a level before attempting the remedy on this creature again.
The reverse of the spell is not permanent; the bestow curse spell lasts for one turn for every experience level of the priest using the spell. The curse can have one of the following effects (roll percentile dice): 50% of the time it reduces one ability of the victim to 3 (the DM randomly determines which ability); 25% of the time it lowers the victim's attack and saving throw rolls by -4; 25% of the time it makes the victim 50% likely to drop whatever he is holding (or do nothing, in the case of creatures not using tools)--roll each round.
It is possible for a priest to devise his own curse, and it should be similar in power to those given here. Consult your DM. The subject of a bestow curse spell must be touched.
If the victim is touched, a saving throw is still applicable; if it is successful, the effect is negated. The bestowed curse cannot be dispelled.
Example of Dwarven Curse forged into armor: Non dwarven thanes who wear this armor lose 1 point of con per week or fraction thereof. Theft of armor applies as well. Beards will fall out over time.
Example of Dwarven Cruse forged into weapons: 50% chance to drop the weapon each round if wielded by a non-dwarf. Fumbled weapons are useless and always dropped, even if it is picked up again."}</textarea>

"description":"Rigid thinking can be cast only upon a creature with Intelligence of 3 or greater. The creature is allowed a saving throw to avoid the effects.
The creature affected by rigid thinking is in capable of performing any action other than the activity he is involved in when the spell takes effect. The creature's mind simply cannot decide on another course of action--it becomes frozen into a single thought and cannot change even if new circumstances would suggest otherwise. Thus, a warrior fighting a kobold will ignore the arrival of a beholder, and a thief picking a lock will pay no heed to the arrival of three guards.
The affected creature does not mechanically repeat the action; he is not an automaton.
He will not continue to fire his bow at a dragon if he runs out of arrows, but will choose another means of attacking the dragon to the exclusion of all other activities.
A spellcaster in the process of casting a spell when rigid thinking takes effect will not attempt to repeat the spell (unless the spell has been memorized more than once). The spellcaster will, however, devote his attention to the target of that spell until his goal is met (e.g., if the caster were attacking a creature, he would continue to direct attacks at that creature; if the caster were trying to open a door, he would continue to work on the door until it opens).

				<div class="description-content">Rigid thinking can be cast only upon a creature with Intelligence of 3 or greater. The creature is allowed a saving throw to avoid the effects.<br />The creature affected by rigid thinking is in capable of performing any action other than the activity he is involved in when the spell takes effect. The creature&#039;s mind simply cannot decide on another course of action--it becomes frozen into a single thought and cannot change even if new circumstances would suggest otherwise. Thus, a warrior fighting a kobold will ignore the arrival of a beholder, and a thief picking a lock will pay no heed to the arrival of three guards.<br />The affected creature does not mechanically repeat the action; he is not an automaton.<br />He will not continue to fire his bow at a dragon if he runs out of arrows, but will choose another means of attacking the dragon to the exclusion of all other activities.<br />A spellcaster in the process of casting a spell when rigid thinking takes effect will not attempt to repeat the spell (unless the spell has been memorized more than once). The spellcaster will, however, devote his attention to the target of that spell until his goal is met (e.g., if the caster were attacking a creature, he would continue to direct attacks at that creature; if the caster were trying to open a door, he would continue to work on the door until it opens).<br />The spell expires when the creature accomplishes his goal (i.e., the kobold is killed or the lock is opened) or when the duration of the spell has ended.</div>

Telepathy does not give either participant access to the other's thoughts, memories, or emotions.

Balfas can communicate a single thought to both Alra and Zymor, but Alra and Zymor cannot communicate with each other. Balfas, however, can \"target\" a thought so that only one of the two participants receives it.

"description":"This spell requires the priest to perform a numerological analysis of a subject's correct name. The result is that the priest may cast another spell that affects the subject individual at a range much greater than normal. In other words, by gaining deep knowledge of the individual, the priest creates a \"channel\" to that individual that makes a subsequent spell easier to cast on that subject.
Only certain spells can benefit from telethaumaturgy: bless* command charm person or mammal detect charm hold person know alignment remove curse* probability control quest confusion (one creature only) exaction For spells marked with an asterisk (*), telethaumaturgy also increases the range of the reversed spell. Unless indicated, telethaumaturgy does not increase the range of the reversed spells.
The increase in range depends on the level of the priest casting telethaumaturgy: Level Range Multiplier 1-6 x2 7-11 x3 12-16 x4 17+ x5 Thus, a 12th-level priest who has cast telethaumaturgy on an individual could subsequently cast charm person on that individual at a range of 320 yards, rather than the normal range of 80 yards.
A spell to be enhanced by telethaumaturgy must be cast on the round immediately following the completion of telethaumaturgy. Spells that normally affect more than one individual (such as confusion ) will affect only the selected subject when cast following telethaumaturgy.
When telethaumaturgy is cast by a priest of 11th level or higher, it has an additional effect. If the target is within the normal range of the subsequent spell (e.g., 80 yards for charm person), the subject's saving throw suffers a penalty of -2.
Like the personal reading spell, telethaumaturgy functions only if the priest knows the correct name of his subject. If the priest casts the spell using an alias, he will not know that telethaumaturgy has not taken effect until the subsequent spell fails. The priest does not automatically know why the subsequent spell failed (the subject might simply have made a successful saving throw).
The material component is a small book of numerological formulae and notes. This book is different from the book used in personal reading. The book is not consumed in the casting"}</textarea>

If the priest casts the spell using an alias, he will not know that telethaumaturgy has not taken effect until the subsequent spell fails. The priest does not automatically know why the subsequent spell failed (the subject might simply have made a successful saving throw).<br />The material component is a small book of numerological formulae and notes. This book is different from the book used in personal reading. The book is not consumed in the casting</div>

"description":"This cooperative spell requires at least three priests casting the spell simultaneously.
At the time of casting, the priests must be within 10 feet of each other. Upon completion of the spell, the priests sing a single, dissonant chord. The result of the spell depends on the number of voices in the choir.
Trio. In this form, the spell projects a cone of sonic force 120 feet long and 40 feet wide at the base. All creatures within the area of effect must save vs. spells or suffer 2d4 points of damage. Those who successfully save suffer only 1d4 points. Undead suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throws.
Quartet. With four voices, the spell has the same area of effect as described above.
However, all those who fail their saving throw suffer 2d4 points of damage and are deafened for one round. Those who successfully save suffer half damage and are not deafened. Undead creatures are not allowed a saving throw.
Quintet. Five singers produce a chord of major power. All within the area of effect suffer 3d4 points of damage (saving throw for half damage). Undead are not allowed a saving throw. All creatures are deafened for one round. Furthermore, pottery, glassware, crystal, and similar breakable goods must save vs. fall or be shattered.
Ensemble. An ensemble of singers consists of six to ten priests. In this case, the area of effect increases to a cone 180 feet long and 60 feet wide at the base. All creatures within this area suffer 1d4 points of damage per priest and are deafened for 1d4 rounds.
A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces the damage and duration of deafness by half.
Undead creatures of 3 hit dice or less are immediately destroyed. All other undead suffer normal damage, but are not allowed a saving throw. Glass, pottery, crystal, bone, and all wooden items that are the strength of a door or less (chests, tables, chairs, etc.) must save vs. crushing blow or be shattered.
Choir. The most powerful group, a choir, requires eleven or more priests. In this case, the area of effect expands to a cone 300 feet long and 100 feet wide at the base. All within the area of effect suffer 1d6 points of damage per priest to a maximum of 20d6. A saving throw vs. spells reduces the damage to half. Those who fail to save are deafened for 1d10 rounds; those who succeed are deafened only 1d6 rounds. Undead creatures of 5 hit dice or less are immediately destroyed. Undead with more hit dice are not allowed a saving throw. Structures within the area of effect are damaged as if they suffered a direct hit from a catapult (one hit per four priests in the choir). Doors, chests, and other breakable items are instantly shattered."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell allows the priest to exert fine control over air currents and winds, possibly extinguishing small fires or manipulating light objects as he sees fit within the spell's range. Generally, the priest is limited to one discrete action per round since he must focus his wind servant tightly on any given task. The wind servant can affect objects or creatures weighing up to 1 pound per caster level, twice as much if the object is reasonably light or airy (a cloak, scroll, or haystack, for instance), or 10 times as much if the object is designed to be carried by the wind, such as a ship's sail or a bird in flight.
If an object is within the spell's weight limit, the caster may direct the wind servant to carry it along in gusts and air currents at a flying movement rate of 12 (E). If the object leaves the limits of the spell's range, the wind servant fails, and the object drops or falls normally from that point. Flying creatures of size M or smaller can be forced to land or be driven away by use of the spell if they fall within the weight limit, or slowed by 50% if they exceed the weight limit. Employing the wind servant against an arrow or light missile adds a penalty of -4 to the attack roll.
In dusty, snowy, or sandy regions, the caster can instead use wind servant to create a vicious zephyr of stinging dust around an enemy. This zephyr inflicts damage equal to the opponent's base AC less 2d6 points and creates a -2 penalty to the victim's attack rolls. For example, an enemy in leather armor +1 (AC 7) would suffer 7 - 2d6 damage if attacked by means of this spell.

				<div class="description-content">Zone of sweet air creates an invisible barrier around the area of effect that repels all noxious elements from poisonous vapors, including those created magically (such as a stinking cloud). The spell offers no protection against poisonous vapors created by a dragon&#039;s breath weapon (such as the chlorine gas of a green dragon). Noxious gases already within the area of effect when the spell is cast are not affected. Fresh air passes into the area normally.<br />If a poisonous vapor is expelled within the area of effect (for example, a stinking cloud is cast), the spell takes effect normally but dissipates in half the time normally required.<br />The spell affects a cube whose sides equal the caster&#039;s level times 10 feet (for instance, a 10th-level caster could affect a cube whose sides are 100 feet long).<br />The material components are the priest&#039;s holy symbol, a silk handkerchief, and a strand of spider web.</div>

"description":"The philosophy of the Sphere of Numbers holds that the structure of reality--the \"equation of the moment\"--can be analyzed and modified by someone with sufficient knowledge and power. The addition spell allows a priest to add a new mathematical term to the equation of the moment. This effectively allows a new object or even a living creature to be brought into existence temporarily.
The effect of this spell varies depending on the level of the caster. At 10th level or lower, addition can create a single, inanimate object weighing up to 10 pounds. The spell gives the priest only rudimentary control over the creation process, so the object cannot be complex. The object must be described in a single word or short phrase (e.g., \"a water pitcher\" or \"a block of stone\"). The caster has no control over elements such as shape or color; thus, the water pitcher might be short, squat, and blue, or tall, slender, and red.
Objects created with this spell cannot be of any greater mechanical complexity or technological level than a crossbow. If the priest tries to create an object that breaks this prohibition, the spell fails and nothing is created. Thus, if the priest tried to create \"a pistol,\" assuming he had heard the word somewhere, the spell would fail.
Objects cannot contain any information in an abstract form such as writing or diagrams. If the priest tries to create an object that breaks this prohibition, there are two possible results: the spell may fail, or the object may be created without the information.
Thus, if the priest were to attempt to create \"a spellbook,\" the result would be either a book similar to a spellbook with blank pages, or nothing at all.
The object appears at whatever location the caster wills, as long as it is within spell range. The object cannot appear in the same space occupied by another object or creature, or within a hollow object (for example, the priest cannot create an object blocking the trachea of an enemy).
The object created by addition remains in existence for 1 turn per level of the caster.
During this time, it obeys all the laws of physics as if it were a \"real\" object. The object cannot be disbelieved and spells such as true seeing cannot distinguish it from a naturally-occurring object.
Priests of 11th to 15th level can create a single inanimate object of up to 20 pounds in mass or two identical objects, each of up to five pounds in mass. The object(s) so created remains in existence for two hours (12 turns) per level of the caster.
Priests of 16th to 19th level can create a single inanimate object of up to 50 pounds in mass or up to 10 identical objects, each of up to five pounds in mass. The object(s) is permanent unless destroyed. Since these objects are not magical constructs, but real additions to the \"equation of the moment,\" dispel magic has no effect on them.
Alternatively, the caster can create a single normal (nonmonstrous) living creature of up to 20 pounds in weight. The creature, once created, behaves as a normal member of its species; the caster has no control over its actions. This creature remains in existence for 5 rounds per level of the caster.
Priests of 20th level and above can create a single inanimate object of up to 100 pounds in mass or up to 10 identical objects, each of up to 10 pounds in mass. The object(s) are permanent. Alternatively, the caster can create a single normal (nonmonstrous) living creature of up to 100 pounds in weight and up to 2 hit dice. The creature, once created, behaves as a normal member of its species; the caster has no control over its actions. This creature remains in existence for 2 turns per level of the caster.
The material component is a small table of numerological formulae inscribed on an ivory plaque, plus a length of silken cord. During the casting, the priest ties the cord into a complex knot. As the magical energy is discharged, the cord vanishes in a flash of light.
The plaque is not consumed in the casting."}</textarea>

Anyone affected by compulsive order may become violent if he is prevented from being neat. He will do what he must to make the world around him more orderly.

"description":"This spell must be cast on at least two creatures. The priest may affect one creature per two levels of his experience, and all creatures to be affected must be within three feet of each other at the time of casting. After the spell is completed, affected characters may move about freely.
Defensive harmony grants affected creatures a defensive bonus by bestowing an enhanced coordination of their attacks and defenses. The affected creatures must be involved in a single battle so that their efforts harmonize to the benefit of all involved.
For example, the affected creatures can attack one dragon or a group of orcs in a single area. They can also attack additional enemy forces that arrive in the same combat. If the enemy forces divide and flee, the affected creatures can follow, continue to attack, and benefit from the spell. If the affected group is split into two smaller groups when attacked, however, it gains no benefit from defensive harmony.
While the spell is in effect, each affected creature gains a +1 bonus to armor class for every other creature benefitting from the spell, to a maximum bonus of +5 (although more than five characters may be affected by the spell). Thus, if four creatures are affected by defensive harmony, each creature gains a +3 bonus to armor class.
This bonus represents a mystical coordination of effort on the part of all affected creatures. A fighter will naturally wage his attack to distract the troll attacking the thief.
The ranger will instinctively block the swing of an orc, thereby protecting the wizard.
Creatures affected by the spell are not consciously aware of these efforts, and they are unable to create specific strategies and tactics."}</textarea>

The priest may affect one creature per two levels of his experience, and all creatures to be affected must be within three feet of each other at the time of casting. After the spell is completed, affected characters may move about freely.<br />Defensive harmony grants affected creatures a defensive bonus by bestowing an enhanced coordination of their attacks and defenses. The affected creatures must be involved in a single battle so that their efforts harmonize to the benefit of all involved.<br />For example, the affected creatures can attack one dragon or a group of orcs in a single area. They can also attack additional enemy forces that arrive in the same combat. If the enemy forces divide and flee, the affected creatures can follow, continue to attack, and benefit from the spell. If the affected group is split into two smaller groups when attacked, however, it gains no benefit from defensive harmony.<br />While the spell is in effect, each affected creature gains a +1 bonus to armor class for every other creature benefitting from the spell, to a maximum bonus of +5 (although more than five characters may be affected by the spell). Thus, if four creatures are affected by defensive harmony, each creature gains a +3 bonus to armor class.<br />This bonus represents a mystical coordination of effort on the part of all affected creatures. A fighter will naturally wage his attack to distract the troll attacking the thief.<br />The ranger will instinctively block the swing of an orc, thereby protecting the wizard.<br />Creatures affected by the spell are not consciously aware of these efforts, and they are unable to create specific strategies and tactics.</div>

"description":"This spell allows the caster to selectively warp the fabric of space, folding it into higher dimensions.
This effect can be best explained through an example. If an ant crawling along the west edge of a map decided to travel to the east edge of the map, it would have to crawl the full width of the map. But if the map were folded in two so that the east and west edges were touching, the ant would travel almost no distance at all. The ant's world (the map) would have been folded through the third dimension. The dimensional folding spell does something similar with the three-dimensional world: it folds it through a higher dimension (the fourth), allowing instantaneous travel between two locales on the same plane of existence.
Although this effect may seem similar to the wizard spell teleport, in practice, it is much different. The dimensional folding spell opens a gate that allows instantaneous, bidirectional access to a distant locale on the same plane. This gate is circular, of any size up to 10' in diameter, and remains in existence for up to 1 full round. The caster and any other creatures can pass through the gate in either direction while it remains open. Missile weapons and magic spells can also pass through the gate.
The gate appears as a shimmering ring, glowing with a faint light equivalent to starshine. Vision through the gate is clear and unobstructed in both directions, allowing the priest to \"look before he leaps.\" However, anyone on the other side of the gate is able to see the priest and his point of origin.
The \"near side\" of the gate always appears within 5 feet of the priest. The location of the \"far side\" of the gate always opens within 5 feet of the place the priest desires. Thus, there is no chance of arriving at the wrong destination, as with the wizard spell teleport.
There is a risk involved in using dimensional folding, however. Many philosophers believe that what we know as time is simply another dimension, and the behavior of this spell seems to support this thesis. Unless the priest is extremely familiar with the destination, there is a significant chance that any creature passing through a dimensional folding gate will suffer instantaneous aging. Theorists believe that this is the same kind of \"slippage\" that can cause a teleporting wizard to land high or low, except that in this case, the slippage is in the time dimension.
The chance of this instantaneous aging occurring depends on how familiar the priest is with the destination. The table that follows outlines the conditions and effects of aging.
Chance of Amount of Destination is: aging aging Very familiar* 2% 1 year Studied carefully 5% 1d2 years Seen casually 10% 1d3 years Viewed once 15% 1d6 years Never seen 25% 1d10 years * Use this row if the desired location is within view of the priest.
If the die roll indicates that aging occurs, every creature that passes through the gate in either direction suffers the aging effect. Multiple creatures passing through the gate in the same direction all age by the same amount determined by a single die roll. Although the chance of aging is low and the potential amount of aging is minimal for familiar destinations, the effects can add up and become significant over time.
Although the word \"destination\" is used to refer to the \"far end\" of the gate, the priest need not be the one doing the traveling. For example, a priest may open the gate near a distant ally so he may travel instantaneously to join the priest.
The material component is a sheet of platinum \"tissue\" worth at least 15 gp, which the priest folds intricately during the casting. The tissue is consumed when the gate closes."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell creates the necessary conditions for devotional energy to be used. For faith magic to work, the priest must create a focus to harness the necessary devotional energy.
This spell creates that focus. A focus cannot function without a source of devotional energy.
The focus gathers devotional energy and reshapes it in order to amplify other spells cast by the priest (or priests). The same energy keeps the focus in existence. If the spell is cast and there is no immediate source of devotional energy within 100 feet, the focus immediately fails.
Once created, most foci cannot be moved. This condition and the need for a constant supply of devotional energy tends to limit the use of foci to temples, churches, monasteries, shrines, and seminaries--permanent structures where followers of the religion gather on a regular basis. Sometimes a focus is created for a special gathering such as a holy day, conclave, grand wedding, or yearly festival.
Not all foci are identical. The particular form of the focus depends on the power and nature of the spell being amplified. All foci can be seen by detect magic. There are three basic types of foci: site, item, and living.
Site foci are connected to a place, whether a room, building, field, or forest. Once cast, the foci cannot be moved. It causes no disturbance in the surroundings; it is invisible and intangible.
Item foci are centered on a single object. Customarily, this object is large and immovable, such as an altar, but it is possible for the focus to be as small as is practical.
The item can be as elaborate or plain as desired, but should have some significance to the religion.
Living foci are the rarest of all types. In this case, the focus is created on a living plant, animal, or person. Detect charm reveals the person is somehow enchanted, although not under the influence of a typical charm spell.
The type of focus created (site, item, or living) depends on the religion and nature of the spell amplified. These choices are listed in Table 3: Focused Spell Effects.
Casting the focus spell is a long and complicated process, accompanied by many ceremonies and rituals. During the day spent casting the spell, the priest will need the assistance of at least two other priests of the same faith. These aides need not memorize the spell (or even be capable of casting it). Their duty is to provide the extra hands and voices needed at specific points of the casting. A large number of worshipers must also be present since the focus requires their energy. Not surprisingly, the casting of this spell is often incorporated into important holy festivals or special occasions.
The duration of the focus is one year. If the devotional energy falls below a minimum level, the spell ends sooner. A focus requires the devotional energy of at least 100 devout worshipers. Lay monks (those dedicated to the religion but not priests) count as two worshipers, while priests (of any level) count as ten. A focus could be maintained by a congregation of 100, a monastery of fifty, or a seminary of as few as 10 priests (or any combination of the above). The focus must receive this energy for at least 10 hours out of every day. If these conditions are not met, the focus weakens. The area of effect of the amplified spell decreases by 20% each day until it fades away completely.
Once the focus is created, the priest or priests have 1 turn in which to cast the desired spell upon the focus. A focus can amplify only one spell, and each item, creature, or place can receive only one focus. Spells that can be cast upon a focus are listed on Table 3.
Table 3: FOCUSED SPELL EFFECTS Possible Focus Spell Type Anti-animal shell S/I/L Anti-plant shell S/I/L Bless S/I Control temperature, 10' radius S* Control winds S/I* Cure disease I/L Cure blindness or deafness I/L Detect poison S/I Detect lie I Detect magic I Dispel evil S/I Endure cold/endure heat S* Know alignment I/L Negative plane protection S/I Protection from evil S/I Protection from lightning S Protections from fire S Purify food and drink I Remove fear S/I/L Remove curse I Repel insects S/I Resist fire/resist cold S Speak with animals S/I/L Tongues S/I True seeing S * The caster must state a desired range (temperature, wind strength, etc.) within the spell's normal limitations at the time it is cast.
Once the spell is cast, the normal duration and area of effect for that spell are ignored.
The focus begins to increase these factors of the spell's power. After one day, the amplified spell reaches its full area of effect. Thereafter, it remains over that area until the focus fails.
The area affected by the focus (and its amplified spell) depends on the level of the caster. The spell expands in a radius from the focus, 20 feet per level of the caster, although it can deliberately be created smaller. Within that area of effect, the amplified spell exerts its normal effect. A 13th-level priest could create a focus up to 260 feet in diameter.
The material components are many, including special vestments, incense, oils, waters, and other equipment the DM deems appropriate. The cost of these materials is never less than 1,000 gp plus 100 gp per level of spell being amplified. These items are given up as offerings to the deity (perhaps to be distributed to the poor), and new ones must be obtained each time the spell is cast."}</textarea>

The priest can force the subject to speak, although the priest cannot inject a full range of emotions into the subject's voice (everything said by the subject is in a monotone).
This spell gives the priest no access to the subject's thoughts, memory, or sensory apparatus. Thus, the priest cannot see through the subject's eyes. To control the subject, the priest must be within the range of the spell and must be able to see the subject.

This spell requires a moderate level of concentration by the priest. While maintaining this spell, he can move or enter combat, but cannot cast another spell. If the priest is wounded, rendered unconscious, or killed, the spell immediately terminates.
If the priest is 10th level or lower, he or she cannot force the subject to perform particularly delicate actions, such as picking a lock.

Any such delicate actions suffer a -15% penalty (or -3 on 1d20) to reflect the \"remote control\" nature of the action.

"description":"This spell allows the priest to increase or decrease by a small margin the probability of success for one action. This action can be anything that requires a die roll--an attack, a saving throw, an attempt to use thieving skills, an ability check, or even an attempt to successfully teleport on target. The action must be something performed by a single creature.
The basic modification is 15% (15 on 1d100 or 3 on 1d20), plus an additional 5% per five levels of the caster. This modification can be either positive or negative, as deemed by the spellcaster. Thus, a 10th-level priest can modify a subject's saving throw or attack roll by +5 or -5, or a thief's \"climb walls\" roll by +25% or -25%. The priest may cast this spell on himself.
For a noncombat action such as an attempt to climb a wall, the priest simply casts the spell on the subject immediately before the action is attempted, informing the DM whether the modification is positive or negative. To use this spell in combat, the priest must specify the action to be affected (e.g., the target's next attack roll) and whether the modification will be positive or negative. The spell remains in effect until the subject attempts the specified action or until a number of rounds equal to the caster's level passes.
If the latter occurs, the spell ends without effect.
Once the spell is cast, the priest does not need to maintain any level of concentration; the spell will function even if the casting priest is killed before the spell takes effect.
The subject of the spell has no way of knowing whether any modification made by this spell is positive or negative (or even whether he was the subject of the spell at all).
Thus, a lying priest could claim to raise a thief's chance of climbing the wall, while actually lowering it. The thief would be none the wiser. However, an unwilling subject of this spell receives a normal saving throw to negate its effect.
The material components are a small cube of a thickened sugar-and-milk mixture and a cubic die of matching size. Both are consumed in the casting."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell turns the subject into a \"thought broadcaster.\" For the duration of the spell, everyone within 30 yards of the subject senses the subject's thoughts, making it impossible for him to lie, keep secrets, conceal motives, etc. The subject is not automatically aware that his thoughts are being sensed. Everyone who senses these thoughts, on the other hand, knows their source.
This spell causes the broadcast of only surface thoughts and motivations, not memories. There is no need for a common language between broadcaster and receivers; for this purpose, thoughts are considered to be symbolic, not dependent on language. The detail level of the thoughts is insufficient for others to learn specific skills from the subject. Thus, if the subject casts a spell, everyone within range knows what spell is being cast before it takes effect, but no one learns any knowledge about how the spell is cast.
If the broadcaster is invisible or hiding in shadows, the broadcast functions normally, and all receivers are aware that someone is in the vicinity whom they cannot see. While receivers cannot pinpoint the broadcaster's location, the broadcaster's thoughts will inevitably reveal his general position (\"Oh no, he's looking right at me,\" etc.). A character hiding in shadows will be automatically detected, while attacks against an invisible broadcaster suffer a -2 penalty, rather than the normal -4. This spell totally negates the chance of surprise by the broadcaster.
The subject must have an Intelligence score of 1 or more to become a broadcaster, and must have a \"normal\" mind as understood by PCs. Thoughts that are broadcast can be received only by individuals with Intelligence scores of 3 or better. An unwilling subject receives a normal saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effects. A willing subject can waive this saving throw.
The material component is small balloon that the priest inflates upon casting. This balloon is consumed in the casting."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">This spell turns the subject into a &quot;thought broadcaster.&quot; For the duration of the spell, everyone within 30 yards of the subject senses the subject&#039;s thoughts, making it impossible for him to lie, keep secrets, conceal motives, etc. The subject is not automatically aware that his thoughts are being sensed. Everyone who senses these thoughts, on the other hand, knows their source.<br />This spell causes the broadcast of only surface thoughts and motivations, not memories. There is no need for a common language between broadcaster and receivers; for this purpose, thoughts are considered to be symbolic, not dependent on language. The detail level of the thoughts is insufficient for others to learn specific skills from the subject. Thus, if the subject casts a spell, everyone within range knows what spell is being cast before it takes effect, but no one learns any knowledge about how the spell is cast.<br />If the broadcaster is invisible or hiding in shadows, the broadcast functions normally, and all receivers are aware that someone is in the vicinity whom they cannot see. While receivers cannot pinpoint the broadcaster&#039;s location, the broadcaster&#039;s thoughts will inevitably reveal his general position (&quot;Oh no, he&#039;s looking right at me,&quot; etc.). A character hiding in shadows will be automatically detected, while attacks against an invisible broadcaster suffer a -2 penalty, rather than the normal -4. This spell totally negates the chance of surprise by the broadcaster.<br />The subject must have an Intelligence score of 1 or more to become a broadcaster, and must have a &quot;normal&quot; mind as understood by PCs. Thoughts that are broadcast can be received only by individuals with Intelligence scores of 3 or better. An unwilling subject receives a normal saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effects. A willing subject can waive this saving throw.<br />The material component is small balloon that the priest inflates upon casting. This balloon is consumed in the casting.</div>

"description":"Uplift bestows increased spellcasting ability on one priest, including additional spells per level and use of spells beyond the caster's normal level. This cooperative spell requires two priests who must spend the day casting this spell. During the casting, the priests must decide which additional spells (of all levels) are desired. Upon completion of the casting, the priests touch palms, and the priest of higher level receives a charge of magical energy. This charge temporarily boosts the level of the priest for spellcasting purposes. The amount of increase is one level per five levels of the lower level caster (fractions rounded up). If both priests are of equal level, the casters must decide who benefits from the spell.
The spell grants the priest the spellcasting ability of the new level. It does not improve hit points, attack rolls, or other abilities. If the increase allows more spells per level, the additional spells are instantly placed in the character's memory. A priest is also enabled to cast spells normally beyond his level. Range, duration, area of effect, and other variables are all based on the character's temporary level.
The increased effect lasts only 1 turn. At the end of the turn, all additional spells are lost and the character reverts to his normal level.
As an example, consider a party with a fallen comrade. The two priests in the party are 7th and 8th level, both unable to cast raise dead. After a night's rest, each priest adds uplift to his memorized spells. After casting the spell, the 8th-level priest suddenly gains the casting abilities of a 10th-level priest, including the ability to cast raise dead. At the end of one turn, the priest's abilities revert to 8th-level.
Casting this spell is an arduous task, causing a severe drain on the priests. When the spell expires, the uplifted character suffers 2d6 points of damage from mental exhaustion.
This damage cannot be healed by any means until the character has had at least eight hours of rest.
The material components are the priests' holy symbols and an offering worth at least 500 gp from each priest."}</textarea>

The spell draws bonuses from one person for every two levels of the priest. All characters involved must be within a 30'-radius of the priest. At the time of casting, the priest designates the recipient of the spell and the contributors. All characters who contribute to the spell must do so willingly.
When the spell is completed, the designated character (the group's champion) gains any non-magical bonuses to THAC0 and damage possessed by the characters who contributed to the spell. Characters without bonuses or with combat penalties could conceivably be included in the spell; such characters count against the maximum number of creatures that can be affected. Penalties are likewise applied to the champion; contributors to this spell must be chosen carefully.
The bonuses gained through this spell are added to the character's own bonuses (if any). The champion channels the energy of others through himself, improving his fighting ability.
The champion must be in the line of sight and within 30 feet of the characters aiding him. Characters who contribute their bonuses must concentrate on the champion for the duration of the spell. If this concentration is broken (by moving more than 10 feet per round, fighting, being struck, or losing sight of the champion), that character's contribution is immediately lost.
The spell expires when the last character contributing power to the champion ceases concentration.
A champion may benefit from only one champion's strength spell at one time.
Contributors can aid only one champion at one time.
The material component is a chain of five gold links worth at least 1,000 gp."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell clears away weeds, stones, and other debris in a 10-foot-wide path extending 10 feet in front of the caster. The caster can create a continuous path for the duration of the spell, clearing a 10-foot-square ahead of him as long as he continues to move forward. The spell affects jungles, forests, rocky ground, and snow.
The result of the cleared path is that movement costs are reduced by half. This is reflected in a reduction of the penalty against movement in rough terrain. (See Table 74 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for terrain costs for movement.) For example, if clear path is used in heavy jungle, the movement cost is reduced from 8 to 4. In no case can clear path reduce movement cost below 1.
Clear path has no effect on rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water, nor does it affect quicksand, lava, or similar natural obstacles. It also has no effect on magically-created terrain or manmade barricades.
A priest using the clear path spell can be tracked easily. Tracking proficiency is not required.
The material components are a knife blade and a straw from a broom.
The reverse, clutter path, causes weeds, small stones, and similar debris to litter a 10- foot path extending 10 feet behind the caster. This hides a trail, making tracking more difficult. The caster can create a continuous path for the duration of the spell. The chance to successfully track on a cluttered path is reduced by 50%.
The material components are a handful of pebbles and a handful of weeds."}</textarea>

"description":"By means of a control winds spell, the caster is able to alter wind force in the area of effect. For every three levels of experience, the caster can increase or decrease wind force by one level of strength. Wind strengths are as follows: Wind Force Miles Per Hour Light Breeze 2-7 Moderate Breeze 8-18 Strong Breeze 19-31 Gale 32-54 Storm 55-72 Hurricane 73-176 Winds in excess of 19 miles per hour drive small flying creatures--those eagle-sized and under--from the skies, severely affect missile accuracy, and make sailing difficult.
Winds in excess of 32 miles per hour drive even man-sized flying creatures from the skies and cause minor ship damage. Winds in excess of 55 miles per hour drive all flying creatures from the skies, uproot small trees, knock down wooden structures, tear off roofs, and endanger ships. Winds in excess of 73 miles per hour are of hurricane force.
An \"eye\" of 40-foot radius, in which the wind is calm, exists around the caster. Note that while the spell can be used underground, if the spell is cast in an area smaller than the area of effect, the eye shrinks 1 foot for every foot of confinement. For example, if the area of effect is a 360-foot area, the eye shrinks by 10 feet to a 30-foot radius; a space under 320 feet in a radius would eliminate the eye and subject the spellcaster to the effects of the wind. Once the spell is cast, the wind force increases or decreases by 3 miles per hour per round until the maximum or minimum speed is attained. The caster, with one round of complete concentration, can stabilize the wind at its current strength, or set it to increase or decrease. However, the rate of the change cannot be altered. The spell remains in force for one turn for each level of experience of the caster. When the spell is exhausted, the force of the wind wanes or waxes at the same rate, until it reaches the level it was at before the spell took effect. Another caster can use a control winds spell to counter the effects of a like spell up to the limits of his own ability."}</textarea>

The creature may suffer permanent death upon the loss of all its hit points.
Use of 1d6 spell-like powers (such as gating in allies) may be limited or negated.
Undead creatures lose the ability to drain life energy levels.

"description":"This spell allows the priest to alter the characteristics of certain extradimensional spaces such as those created by rope trick and similar spells or those contained in items like bags of holding or portable holes.
Extradimensional manipulation can increase or reduce the size of a single extradimensional space. The amount of increase or decrease depends on the level of the caster: Level Multiplier Up to 10 x2 11 to 16 x3 17 or above x4 This means that a 10th-level priest can double the capacity of a bag of holding or decrease it to half its normal size. A 15th-level priest can triple the capacity or reduce it to one-third capacity.
If the size and capacity of an extradimensional space is decreased, any contents of the space that exceed the current capacity are expelled (determined randomly). These contents are expelled from the space in the same way they originally entered it, if that path is still open. If the path is closed, as it would be if a bag of holding were tied shut or a portable hole were folded up, the \"extra\" contents are expelled into the Astral plane.
Any items in an enlarged space when the spell duration expires suffer the same fate.
Placing an extradimensional space inside another such space, such as placing a bag of holding inside a portable hole (see the Dungeon Master's Guide), is a dangerous undertaking. Extradimensional manipulation may be cast for the purpose of removing this danger. When used in this manner, the size of the space cannot be affected. However, while this version is in effect, the affected extradimensional space can be placed within another such space (or another extradimensional space may be placed within the affected space) with no adverse consequences. If one space is within the other when the spell expires, the usual consequences ensue immediately.
If the space to be affected is being maintained by a spellcaster, as in the case of a rope trick, that spellcaster receives a saving throw to resist the manipulation. If the space is created by a magical item, however, no saving throw is allowed.
The material component is a strip of gold tissue worth at least 5 gp that is twisted into a Moebius strip. The strip is consumed in the casting."}</textarea>

Before the victim undertakes any action, he must gain permission. He will not follow through with an action until he gains permission. If permission is denied, the victim cannot act until he thinks of an alternate action and gains permission for that action.

"description":"This cooperative spell requires only one priest to cast it, but can be cast only on another priest of the same faith. The recipient of the spell must voluntarily surrender himself to the spell. The recipient becomes a host for the caster. While the recipient does not lose his own persona or ability to act, the host can be dominated by the caster at any time. For the most part, this domination is complete.
For the duration of the spell, the caster is essentially detached from his own body. He can neither move nor act on his own. His mind is connected to the host's. He sees, hears, smells, tastes, and otherwise senses everything the host does. He can telepathically communicate with the host. Once the spell is completed, there is no limit to the range over which it can function. However, both the caster and host must remain on the same plane. Since the spell relies on telepathic communication, thin lead sheeting will effectively block the connection.
When desired, the caster can dominate the host. When this happens, the host's own mind is pushed to the background and the caster's personality dominates. The host's personality, memories, proficiencies, and spells are temporarily replaced by those of the caster. While occupying the host, the caster can cast any spell he himself has memorized, provided that the necessary components are on hand. These spells function exactly as if the priest had cast them from his own body.
The caster can return control to the host at any time, restoring the character's abilities and personality without harm.
The spell is not without limitations and risks. The domination must be voluntary. If the host resists the casting of the spell, it automatically fails. Once the spell is in effect, the host can attempt to resist the domination. He is then allowed a saving throw. If successful, the spell immediately ends.
Whenever the host suffers damage, the caster must make a saving throw vs. death to maintain the spell. If the save is failed, a wave of pain is transmitted to the priest, causing 1d6 points of damage and canceling the spell. If the host should die, the caster must make a system shock roll with the risk of suffering instant death.
The material component is a chalice worth no less than 1,000 gp. This chalice must be given as a gift to the host (who cannot return it to the donor for any reason)."}</textarea>

"description":"This nasty spell \"disconnects\" the subject's short-term and long-term memory. While the spell is in effect, the subject is incapable of storing information in long-term memory.
Every moment is virtually an independent event for the subject; he or she can remember recent events, thoughts, and sensations for no more than a few seconds (the amount of time they remain in short-term memory).
Memories of events that happened before the onset of the spell are not affected at all; these are safely stored in long-term memory. This means that the subject can cast any spells memorized before the memory wrack took effect, but he is likely to have difficulty casting the spell as described below.
The subject of this spell has a limited ability to act. He is restricted to one action at a time and must concentrate mightily to keep the situation and any planned actions in shortterm memory. As long as the subject is able to maintain concentration, he may act normally within these limits.
If the subject is distracted (he is struck in combat, affected by a spell, startled, surprised, or a similar event occurs), he forgets everything that occurred from the onset of the spell to the moment of distraction. The subject must re-evaluate the situation as if it had just come to pass.
Consider the following example. The subject of the spell is a soldier assigned to guard the entrance to a building. The priest arrives and casts memory wrack on the guard.
The guard has no problem remembering his orders, since he received them before the onset of the spell. He also remembers the arrival of the priest. The priest now tries to convince the guard that he is authorized to enter the building. The guard refuses him entry. The priest now picks up a rock and throws it at the guard, striking him and distracting him. The guard forgets everything that happened between the onset of the spell and the moment the rock struck. He forgets that the priest has already tried to con him and that he threw a rock at him. He must reevaluate the situation as though the priest had just arrived. The priest is free to make another attempt at entering the building.
When the spell expires, the subject remembers nothing that happened while the spell was in effect, possibly leading to amusing consequences (\"By the gods, how did I get here?\").
The material component is a ruby of at least 200 gp value, which is crushed during the casting."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell allows the priest to create one specific form of insanity in the subject. Five forms of insanity are possible through this spell.
Schizophrenia: This form of insanity is characterized by personality loss. The subject has no personality of his own, so he selects a role model and makes every possible attempt to behave like that character. The chosen role model will be as different from the subject as possible. (Thus, an insane wizard might begin to follow the habits of a warrior.) Obviously, a warrior who believes himself to be a wizard will be unable to cast spells (he might think that he's casting spells, or he might construct a sophisticated series of excuses explaining why he's \"not in the mood for magic\" at the moment). A character who emulates a member of another class does not gain any of the skills of that class and makes all attacks and saving throws as appropriate to his true class. Certain consequences might arise if the character's emulation causes him to break restrictions of his class. For example, a priest emulating a warrior might break his deity's prohibition against edged weapons, or a paladin might emulate a Neutral Evil thief. Both will suffer the appropriate consequences as if they had been compelled to violate their beliefs while charmed. Such characters will certainly have to atone for their actions once they return to normal.
Dementia praecox: The subject is totally uninterested in any undertaking. Nothing seems worthwhile, and the individual is lethargic and filled with tremendous feelings of boredom and dissatisfaction. No matter how important the situation, it is 50% likely that the subject will ignore it as meaningless.
Delusional insanity: The subject is convinced that he is a famous figure: a monarch, demi-god, or similar personage. Characters who fail to recognize the subject with the honor he deserves incur great hostility or disbelief. The subject acts appropriately to a station that he does not hold. He directs orders at real and imaginary creatures and draws upon resources that do not exist.
Paranoia: The subject is convinced that \"they\" (whoever they are) are spying on him and plotting against him. Everyone around the subject, even friends and allies, is part of the plot. If any other character acts in a way that the subject can interpret as reinforcing this delusion, the subject has a 20% chance of reacting with violence.
Hallucinatory insanity: The subject sees, hears, and otherwise senses things that do not exist. The more stressful the situation is to the subject, the more likely he will hallucinate. Although most hallucinations are external to the subject (that is, he perceives creatures, objects, and conditions that do not exist), there is a 10% chance that any hallucination will involve the subject's self-perception. For example, the subject might suddenly believe and act as if he had sprouted wings, grown to giant size, etc.
When this spell is cast by a priest of 13th level or lower, the DM chooses or randomly selects one of these forms of insanity (and should feel free to invent other interesting symptoms). If the priest is 14th level or higher, he can personally select the form of insanity to afflict the subject.
While under the effect of this spell, the subject can cast spells and use innate powers; the use of these abilities will be in accordance with the symptoms of the insanity, however. Player characters affected by this spell should be encouraged to role-play the appropriate effects to the limit.
The duration of this spell depends on the sum of the subject's Intelligence and Wisdom scores. A saving throw is allowed on a periodic basis depending on this total.
The spell is broken if a successful saving throw is rolled. Refer to the table that follows.
Int+Wis Time Between Checks 8 or less 1 month 9 to 18 3 weeks 19 to 24 2 weeks 25 to 30 1 week 31 to 35 3 days 36 or more 1 day The effects of this spell can be removed by a limited wish, wish (or equally powerful magic), or by a heal spell cast for this specific purpose.
The material component is a small bust of a human head, about 3\" in height, made from fine, delicate china. The priest shatters this bust during the casting."}</textarea>

A quest cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by a priest of the same religion or of higher level than the caster. Some artifacts and relics might negate the spell, as can direct intervention by a deity. Likewise, an unjust or undeserved quest grants bonuses to saving throws, or might even automatically fail.<br />The material component of this spell is the priest&#039;s holy symbol.</div>

"description":"To cast this spell, the priest must be in sight of a rainbow, or have a special component (see below). The rainbow spell has two applications, and the priest can choose the desired one at the time of casting. These applications are as follows: Bow: The spell creates a shimmering, multi-layered short composite bow of rainbow hues. It is light and easy to pull, so that any character can use it without penalty for nonproficiency.
It is magical: Each of its shimmering missiles is the equivalent of a +2 weapon, including attack and damage bonuses. Magic resistance can negate the effect of any missile fired from the bow. The bow fires seven missiles before disappearing. It can be fired up to four times per round. Each time a missile is fired, one hue leaves the bow, corresponding to the color of arrow that is released. Each color of arrow has the ability to cause double damage to certain creatures, as follows: Red --fire dwellers/users and fire elementals Orange --creatures or constructs of clay, sand, earth, stone or similar materials, and earth elementals Yellow --vegetable opponents (including fungus creatures, shambling mounds, treants, etc.) Green --aquatic creatures, electricity-using creatures, and air elementals Indigo --acid-using or poison-using creatures Violet --metallic or regenerating creatures When the bow is drawn, an arrow of the appropriate color magically appears, nocked and ready. If no color is requested, or a color that has already been used is asked for, then the next arrow (in the order of the spectrum) appears.
Bridge: The caster causes the rainbow to form a seven-hued bridge up to 3 feet wide per level of the caster. It must be at least 20 feet long and can be as long as 120 yards, according to the caster's desire. It lasts as long as the spell's duration or until ordered out of existence by the caster.
The components for this spell are the priest's holy symbol and a vial of holy water. If no rainbow is in the vicinity, the caster can substitute a diamond of not less than 1,000 gp value, specially prepared with bless and prayer spells while in sight of a rainbow. The holy water and diamond disappear when the spell is cast."}</textarea>

"description":"This cooperative spell can be cast by either a single priest or a group of priests.
Thoughtwave allows the priest to send a short but powerful message to one or more specific individuals, informing them of his situation and general location. The spell instantly generates a powerful mental impulse indicative of the caster's general mental state--anger, fear, pain, despair, etc.
The caster can designate as many as ten persons to receive this message, provided they can all be specifically named or grouped in a general category. Thus, the caster could designate a group of characters by name or could target \"fellow priests,\" \"superiors,\" \"adventuring companions,\" \"knights of Lord Harcourt,\" or \"villagers of Dopp.\" If more than ten individuals are in the group, those closest to the source will receive the impulse.
There is no range limitation to the spell, although it cannot be projected outside the plane occupied by the caster.
Creatures receiving the impulse automatically know who sent it (even if they have never met the priest before) and gain a clear indication of the mood and situation of the caster. Recipients also intuitively know the general source of the spell, although they are unable to pinpoint rooms, dungeon levels, or landmarks. For example, a fighter could suddenly be struck by an image of Father Rastibon, who is injured and in great pain somewhere along the forest road. A priest might suddenly sense that his patriarch is being tortured in the dungeons of Castle Varrack.
The spell can also be cast by more than one priest, allowing them to either contact greater numbers of individuals or increase the intensity of the message. If greater numbers are desired, ten characters are contacted per priest involved in the casting.
Increasing the intensity of the message makes it more compelling. Doubling the intensity (requiring at least three priests) causes the message to act as a suggestion. In this case, the effect is limited to a single target. Tripling the intensity (requiring at least five priests) gives the spell the force of a quest. This effect is also limited to a single target. In both cases, the target is allowed a saving throw to avoid the effect of the suggestion or quest."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell allows the caster to temporarily convince himself that certain objects or as many as four creatures within the area of effect do not actually exist. While disbelief remains in effect, these objects or creatures cannot harm or hinder the caster. He can pass through them as if they did not exist and takes no damage from their attacks or actions.
However, since these objects or creatures temporarily do not exist for the priest, he can take no action against them. If the creatures attack, the caster receives no Dexterity bonus to armor class (since this bonus represents dodging, and the priest is unable to dodge a creature that does not exist for him).
The caster can attempt to disbelieve as many as four creatures within 60 feet of his position at the time of casting. He disbelieves the same four creatures for the duration of the spell. Alternatively, the priest can disbelieve any or all inanimate objects of up to 20- cubic-yard volume (thus, he may disbelieve a 12 foot by 15 foot area of 3-foot-thick wall). This volume must be centered on a point no more than 20 yards from the caster.
These two options are mutually exclusive; the priest can disbelieve only creatures or objects, not a combination of both.
Disbelieving a creature includes all gear, equipment, or treasure carried or worn by that creature; it does not include other objects that come into contact with that creature, such as walls, doors, chairs, etc.
Disbelief is not automatic; it requires an extreme effort. To successfully disbelieve, the priest must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation. A successful save means the priest has disbelieved; an unsuccessful check means that the spell has failed and the priest has not convinced himself of the creatures' or objects' non-existence.
While this spell is in effect, the DM must record any damage suffered by the priest from disbelieved creatures. When the spell ends, the caster makes a saving throw vs.
spell. If the saving throw is successful, the priest suffers only one-eighth of any damage inflicted by the creatures (round all fractions down); if the priest fails the saving throw, he suffers one-half of any damage inflicted (round fractions down)."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell encloses one individual in an extradimensional space. Creatures to be affected must be of size M or smaller. The space can contain only one creature, regardless of size. The priest may use the spell on himself or any creature he touches.
Unwilling targets are allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the entrapment.
While inside the space, the enclosed character is invisible and totally undetectable by any form of scrying. Powerful magic such as contact other plane will indicate that the character is \"elsewhere,\" but will give no more information.
The creature within the extradimensional space can see and hear everything that occurs around him. However, he cannot cast spells, and no action of his can affect anyone or anything in the \"real world.\" While occupied, the extradimensional space is totally immobile. If the caster chooses to occupy the space, he can pass in and out of the space at will. Other creatures can leave or reenter the space only if the caster allows it. To an outside observer, an enclosed character who exits the space simply appears from nowhere.
If the space is occupied when the spell terminates, the occupant is immediately ejected back into the real world and suffers 1d6 hit points of damage in the process.
Any time the extradimensional space is empty, or when the occupant is someone other than the priest, the space follows the priest around. Thus, the priest may seclude a comrade in the extradimensional space, walk past some guards into a building, then release the comrade.
If any other form of extradimensional space (such as a bag of holding ) is taken into the space created by seclusion, both spaces are ruptured and all contents are expelled onto the Astral plane. Extradimensional manipulation can temporarily prevent this.
The material components are a tiny crystal box of the finest workmanship (worth at least 1,500 gp) and a gem of at least 250 gp value. The gem is consumed in the casting; the box is not."}</textarea>

"description":"By means of this spell, a priest is able to project his astral body into the Astral plane, leaving his physical body and material possessions behind on the Prime Material plane.
As the Astral plane touches upon the first levels of all the outer planes, the priest can travel astrally to the first level of any of these outer planes as he wills. The priest then leaves the Astral plane, forming a body on the plane of existence he has chosen to enter.
It is also possible to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime Material plane by means of the astral spell. However, a second body cannot be formed on the Prime Material plane.
As a general rule, a person astrally projected can be seen only by creatures on the Astral plane. The astral body is connected at all times to the material body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the affected person is killed, astrally and materially, but generally only the psychic wind can cause the cord to break. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body.
If the second body or astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to the caster's body where the body rests on the Prime Material plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.
The spell lasts until the priest desires to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic spell or destruction of the priest's body on the Prime Material plane--which kills the priest. The priest can project the astral forms of up to seven other creatures with himself by means of the astral spell, providing the creatures are linked in a circle with the priest. These fellow travelers are dependent upon the priest and can be stranded if something happens to the priest. Travel in the Astral plane can be slow or fast, according to the priest's desire. The ultimate destination arrived at is subject to the desire of the priest."}</textarea>

The lower-case headings below are the new conditions to which the caster can change the existing conditions. In addition, the caster can control the direction of the wind. For example, a day that is clear, warm, and with moderate wind can be controlled to become hazy, hot, and calm. Contradictions are not possible--fog and strong wind, for example. Multiple control weather spells can be used only in succession.
The material components for this spell are the priest's religious symbol, incense, and prayer beads or similar prayer object. Obviously, the spell functions only in areas where there are appropriate climatic conditions.
If Weather is a major sphere for the priest (as it is for druids), duration and area are doubled, and the caster can change the prevailing weather by two places. For example, he can cause precipitation to go from partly cloudy to heavy sleet, temperature to go from cool to arctic, and wind to go from calm to strong."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell enables the caster to create a magical 10-foot-wide road extending 10 feet in front of him. The caster can create an unbroken road for the duration of the spell, creating a 10-foot area ahead of him as long as he continues to move forward.
The road is approximately one foot thick and hovers in the air. It has the texture and color of black granite. Characters and creatures can move on the hovering road at their normal movement rate, ignoring the effects of surrounding terrain.
The hovering road must originate from a solid surface. Once anchored, the caster controls the contour of the road, causing it to rise and fall as he wishes. The road can thus be used to traverse rivers (if the road is anchored on the shore), swamps, and similarly hostile terrain. The caster can cause the hovering road to rise over a jungle or cross a chasm.
The road has AC 0. It is impervious to non-magical weapons. If the road suffers 100 points of damage (from magical weapons or other magical forces), it dissipates in a black mist; all those on the road fall to the ground below.
Unless the road is destroyed, the entire hovering road remains intact from beginning to end for the duration of the spell, even if the caster is killed or incapacitated. At the end of the spell's duration, the entire road dissipates.
The material components are a chunk of black marble and a loop of gold wire."}</textarea>

The caster can create an unbroken road for the duration of the spell, creating a 10-foot area ahead of him as long as he continues to move forward.<br />The road is approximately one foot thick and hovers in the air. It has the texture and color of black granite. Characters and creatures can move on the hovering road at their normal movement rate, ignoring the effects of surrounding terrain.<br />The hovering road must originate from a solid surface. Once anchored, the caster controls the contour of the road, causing it to rise and fall as he wishes. The road can thus be used to traverse rivers (if the road is anchored on the shore), swamps, and similarly hostile terrain. The caster can cause the hovering road to rise over a jungle or cross a chasm.<br />The road has AC 0. It is impervious to non-magical weapons. If the road suffers 100 points of damage (from magical weapons or other magical forces), it dissipates in a black mist; all those on the road fall to the ground below.<br />Unless the road is destroyed, the entire hovering road remains intact from beginning to end for the duration of the spell, even if the caster is killed or incapacitated. At the end of the spell&#039;s duration, the entire road dissipates.<br />The material components are a chunk of black marble and a loop of gold wire.</div>

"description":"According to one view of the universe, what we perceive as gravity is actually a localized warping of the fabric of space-time. The spacewarp spell creates a temporary but very intense warping in a limited area.
When the priest casts this spell, he selects a specific point to be the center of effect.
This point may be anywhere within 50 yards of the caster, including in midair.
When the spell is completed, this center of effect gains a gravity field equal to the force felt at the surface of the earth. In other words, gravity is centered at this point; everything within 50 feet of this center that is not attached to something immovable will fall toward the selected point.
This localized gravity affects only loose objects and creatures capable of movement (i.e., not trees, whose roots are buried in the ground). It does not affect the ground itself-- soil, plants, desert sand, lake water, etc. are immune to the effect.
An object falling toward the center of gravity gains speed exactly as it would if it were falling toward the ground. When the object reaches the center, it instantly ceases its movement. If objects are already at the center, newly arriving objects will slam into them, causing normal falling damage (1d6 per 10 feet) to the newly arriving objects. Objects previously at the center must save vs. paralyzation or suffer half that amount of damage.
Consider the following example. An orc is 10 feet away from the center of effect when the spell is cast. He falls 10 feet to the center and stops. His companion, a bandit, is 30 feet from the center. It takes him longer to fall to the center, so the orc is already there when he arrives, and the two characters collide forcefully. The bandit suffers 3d6 hit points of damage--the falling damage associated with a 30-foot fall. The orc must save vs. paralyzation or suffer half that amount.
Other things are caught in the effect as well. The bandit's horse was 50 feet away from the center of effect, so it arrives at the center after the orc and the bandit. It falls 50 feet, suffering 5d6 points of damage, and potentially inflicting half that amount on both the orc and the bandit.
The center of effect can be anywhere within 50 yards of the priest. Possibly one of the most destructive uses of this spell is to cast it directly on an enemy creature. Everyone and everything within 50 feet of that creature falls toward him and strikes him, inflicting damage.
When the spell terminates, gravity returns to normal. If the spell has lifted any characters or objects off the ground, they immediately fall back to the ground, suffering the appropriate amount of falling damage.
The material components are a lodestone and a sphere of obsidian, both of which are consumed in the casting."}</textarea>

Weapons simply bounce off the subject as they would bounce off the hardest stone.
Spells, including dispel magic, are totally incapable of affecting the subject in any way.
The subject does not age.
Aside from the fact that the subject remains visible, frozen in place like a statue, he is effectively no longer part of the universe. (DMs may rule that the most powerful of magics, such as wishes, and creatures of demigod or higher status can affect the subject.) When the priest casts the spell, he or she states the duration for which the spell will remain in effect (the maximum is one full day per level of the caster). Once the spell is cast, this duration cannot be changed; the priest cannot terminate the spell before the stated time has elapsed.
If the subject is unwilling to be affected by the spell, the priest must touch the victim for the spell to take effect; the subject receives a normal saving throw to resist the effects.
A willing subject need not make a saving throw.
The priest may cast this spell on himself if desired. This spell can provide a powerful defensive maneuver; while the spell is in effect, the subject is totally invulnerable.
Timelessness is also an effective form of long-term imprisonment, as long as the priest is around to cast the spell again at the appropriate time.
This is an exceptionally powerful spell. Casting it puts a significant strain on the priest. Each time he casts timelessness, the priest must make a system shock roll. If the priest fails this throw, he or she permanently loses 1 point of Constitution.
The material components are a gem worth at least 1,000 gp and a small cylinder of obsidian. Both are crushed during the casting."}</textarea>
