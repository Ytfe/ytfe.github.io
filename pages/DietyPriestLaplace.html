"description":"This spell allows a priest to sense how far a character, creature, object, or area is from a condition of balance -- in other words, the degree to which its alignment is removed from true Neutral. The spell gives no indication of the \"direction\" in which the alignment is removed from true Neutral except under certain conditions which follow. The spell does, however, indicate along which axis or axes of alignment the variation lies.

For example, a priest uses this spell to analyze the balance of a Chaotic Neutral creature. The spell indicates that the creature is removed from Neutral by one grade, and the variation is along the Law/Chaos axis; thus, the creature must be either Chaotic Neutral or Lawful Neutral. If the creature were Chaotic Evil, the spell would indicate that it is removed from balance by two grades, one along each axis; thus, the creature must be Chaotic Evil, Chaotic Good, Lawful Evil, or Lawful Good.

A priest has a 5% chance per level of correctly determining the direction of variation along one randomly chosen axis. This means that a 10th-level priest evaluating the balance of a Chaotic Neutral creature would have a 50% chance of learning that the creature is Chaotic (and hence Chaotic Neutral, since it is only one step away from balance).

Similar to spells such as detect evil, this spell will not yield a result on a hidden trap. If cast on a creature with an intelligence level of \"animal\" or \"non-,\" it will always read true Neutral (i.e., zero steps removed from balance).

The material components are four iron coins which the priest tosses in his hand while concentrating on the spell. The coins are not consumed in the casting."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell enhances the casters movement capabilities in extraplanar settings by attuning him to his new surroundings. While very few 1st-level priests find themselves in this situation, higher level characters often make use of this spell. Astral celerity doubles the characters movement rate on the Astral Plane; normally, characters move at a rate of 30 times their Intelligence score in feet per round, but this spell increases this to 60 feet times their Intelligence score. As an incidental benefit, the caster also attunes himself to the plane much faster and suffers no penalties for missile fire while astral.

While astral celerity is most often used in the astral plane, it also offers a small benefit to ethereal characters, too: their movement rates are increased by 50%, so a character with a movement rate of 12 would enjoy a movement rate of 18 while this spell was in effect. Of course, time and distance have little meaning in the overall scheme of the Astral or Ethereal Planes, but relative speed could be very important in avoiding an unpleasant encounter or escaping from pursuit of some kind."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell discovers emanations of evil, or of good in the case of the reverse spell, from any creature, object, or area. Character alignment, however, is revealed only under unusual circumstances: characters who are strongly aligned, who do not stray from their faith, and who are of at least 9th level might radiate good or evil if intent upon appropriate actions. Powerful monsters, such as rakshasas or ki-rin, send forth emanations of evil or good, even if polymorphed. Aligned undead radiate evil, for it is this power and negative force that enable them to continue existing. An evilly cursed object or unholy water radiates evil, but a hidden trap or an unintelligent viper does not.
The degree of evil (dim, faint, moderate, strong, or overwhelming) and possibly its general nature (expectant, malignant, gloating, etc.) can be noted. If the evil is overwhelming, the priest has a 10% chance per level of detecting its general bent (lawful, neutral, or chaotic). The duration of a detect evil (or detect good) spell is one turn plus five rounds per level of the priest. Thus, a 1st-level priest can cast a spell with a 15-round duration, a 2nd-level priest can cast a spell with a 20-round duration, etc. The spell has a path of detection 10 feet wide in the direction the priest is facing. The priest must concentrate--stop, have quiet, and intently seek to detect the aura--for at least one round to receive a reading.
The spell requires the use of the priest's holy symbol as its material component, with the priest holding it before him."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">This spell discovers emanations of evil, or of good in the case of the reverse spell, from any creature, object, or area. Character alignment, however, is revealed only under unusual circumstances: characters who are strongly aligned, who do not stray from their faith, and who are of at least 9th level might radiate good or evil if intent upon appropriate actions. Powerful monsters, such as rakshasas or ki-rin, send forth emanations of evil or good, even if polymorphed. Aligned undead radiate evil, for it is this power and negative force that enable them to continue existing. An evilly cursed object or unholy water radiates evil, but a hidden trap or an unintelligent viper does not.<br />The degree of evil (dim, faint, moderate, strong, or overwhelming) and possibly its general nature (expectant, malignant, gloating, etc.) can be noted. If the evil is overwhelming, the priest has a 10% chance per level of detecting its general bent (lawful, neutral, or chaotic). The duration of a detect evil (or detect good) spell is one turn plus five rounds per level of the priest. Thus, a 1st-level priest can cast a spell with a 15-round duration, a 2nd-level priest can cast a spell with a 20-round duration, etc. The spell has a path of detection 10 feet wide in the direction the priest is facing. The priest must concentrate--stop, have quiet, and intently seek to detect the aura--for at least one round to receive a reading.<br />The spell requires the use of the priest&#039;s holy symbol as its material component, with the priest holding it before him.</div>

"description":"This spell causes a luminous glow within 20 feet of the spell's center. The area of light thus caused is equal in brightness to torchlight. Objects in darkness beyond this sphere can be seen, at best, as vague and shadowy shapes. The spell is centered on a point selected by the caster, and he must have a line of sight or unobstructed path to that point when the spell is cast. Light can spring from air, rock, metal, wood, or almost any similar substance. The effect is immobile unless it is specifically centered on a movable object or mobile creature. If this spell is cast upon a creature, any applicable magic resistance and saving throws must be rolled. Successful resistance negates the spell, while a successful saving throw indicates that the spell is centered immediately behind the creature, rather than upon the creature itself. A light spell centered on the visual organs of a creature blinds it, reducing its attack and saving throw rolls by 4 and worsening its Armor Class by 4. The caster can extinguish the light at any time by uttering a single word. Light spells are not cumulative--multiple castings do not provide a brighter light.
The spell is reversible, causing darkness in the same area and under the same conditions as the light spell, but with half the duration. Magical darkness is equal to that of an unlit interior room--pitch darkness. Any normal light source or magical light source of lesser intensity than full daylight does not function in magical darkness. A darkness spell cast directly against a light spell cancels both, and vice versa."}</textarea>

"description":"One of the more bizarre contentions held by priests of the School of Thought is generally scoffed at by outsiders. The theory states that once a thought has occurred in someone's brain, it exists as a \"freestanding mental object.\" This \"thought object\" usually remains inside the brain of the creature that created it, but sometimes it escapes (this supposedly explains why people forget things). When this happens, the thought object stays in the geographical area where it was lost. Any receptive brain (usually the brain of the creature that initially created the thought) can pick it up again simply by bumping into the invisible, free-floating thought. According to the theory, this is the reason that people can regain a lost thought by going back to the location where the thought was lost. This supposedly works because the free-floating thought is recaptured, not because the locale reminds them of the thought. Unfortunately for philosophers who disagree with this, thought capture seems to be extremely strong evidence for this theory.
This spell makes the priest's brain something of a magnet that attracts thought objects in close proximity. The priest can sense strong thoughts and emotions and can sometimes even see momentary visions of creatures who died or suffered some powerful emotion in the immediate vicinity. Thought objects are always attracted to the priest in the order of the strongest (those attached to powerful emotions or significant events) to the weakest.
Thus, if several thought objects share the same vicinity, the priest will perceive information about the most interesting or significant event. The priest might pick up images of a battle from the point of view of a warrior who died there, or he might gain information about the victor of the battle.
The DM dictates the information provided to the priest, and thus can use this spell to provide players with important background information or can add texture to a campaign world. The information provided might be highly cryptic or symbolic, perhaps in the form of a rhyme or riddle.
The priest gains one thought object per casting of the spell. The spell may be cast a number of times in the same locale, with the priest gaining a different thought object with each casting. A locale contains a finite number of thoughts, however, and once the priest has gained all of them (per the DM), the spell will fail in that locale."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">By means of the chant spell, the priest brings special favor upon himself and his party, and causes harm to his enemies. When the chant spell is completed, all attack and damage rolls and saving throws made by those in the area of effect who are friendly to the priest gain +1 bonuses, while those of the priest&#039;s enemies suffer -1 penalties. This bonus/penalty continues as long as the caster continues to chant the mystic syllables and is stationary. However, an interruption (such as an attack that succeeds and causes damage, grappling with the chanter, or a silence spell) breaks the spell. Multiple chants are not cumulative; however, if the 3rd-level prayer spell is spoken while a priest of the same religious persuasion (not merely alignment) is chanting, the effect is increased to +2 and -2.</div>

"description":"The ethereal barrier is a defense against the passage of extradimensional creatures, including characters or monsters that are phased, ethereal, or travelling via dimension door or shadow walk. The priest creates an imperceptible barrier of 10 square feet per level that may be arranged in any fashion the priest desires. For example, a 3rd-level character can ward six 10-foot by 10-foot surfaces, which would be sufficient to guard a 10-foot by 10-foot by 10-foot room (four walls, a ceiling, and a floor need to be protected.) Note that some monsters may be capable of abandoning their ethereal approach in order to simply enter the barred area on their own feet-the ethereal barrier only bars their passage as long as they are traveling in the Border Ethereal. Also, while this spell can't be worn down by any form of attack, it does not bar teleportation, gates, or the passage of astral creatures.
Ethereal barrier may be cast as cooperative magic by several priests working together. As long as all involved characters can cast the spell, the areas of effect of each priest are added together. Total the levels of all priests involved and multiply by two to find the number of 10-foot by 10-foot squares that may be warded. For example, four 6th-level casters (24 total levels) can ward 48 10-foot by 10-foot squares. The duration is determined by the highest level priest involved, plus 1 turn for each additional priest. In the previous example, this would be 6 turns plus 3 turns for three additional priests for a total of 9 turns.
This spell is also suitable for focus magic (see the spell focus in the Tome of Magic). The material component is a special compound of rare earths and lead worth at least 10 gp per application. One application is required for each 10-foot by 10-foot square to be warded."}</textarea>

Note that this spell is directional, and the caster must face the desired direction in order to determine if a trap is laid in that particular direction.
A trap is any device or magical ward that meets three criteria: it can inflict a sudden or unexpected result, the spellcaster would view the result as undesirable or harmful, and the harmful or undesirable result was specifically intended as such by the creator. Thus, traps include alarms, glyphs, and similar spells or devices.
The caster learns the general nature of the trap (magical or mechanical) but not its exact effect, nor how to disarm it. Close examination will, however, enable the caster to sense what intended actions might trigger it. Note that the caster's divination is limited to his knowledge of what might be unexpected and harmful. The spell cannot predict actions of creatures (hence, a concealed murder hole or ambush is not a trap), nor are natural hazards considered traps (a cavern that floods during a rain, a wall weakened by age, a naturally poisonous plant, etc.). If the DM is using specific glyphs or sigils to identify magical wards (see the 3rd-level spell glyph of warding), this spell shows the form of the glyph or mark.

"description":"With this spell, the caster causes a blazing ray of red-hot fire to spring forth from his hand. This bladelike ray is wielded as if it were a scimitar. If the caster successfully hits with the flame blade in melee combat, the creature struck suffers 1d4+4 points of damage, with a damage bonus of +2 (i. e., 7-10 points) if the creature is undead or is especially vulnerable to fire. If the creature is protected from fire, the damage inflicted is reduced by 2 (i.e., 1d4+2 points). Fire dwellers and those using fire as an innate attack form suffer no damage from the spell. The flame blade can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, cloth, etc. However, it is not a magical weapon in the normal sense of the term, so creatures (other than undead) struck only by magical weapons are not harmed by it. This spell does not function under water.
In addition to the caster's holy symbol, the spell requires a leaf of sumac as a material component."}</textarea>

"description":"By means of the heat metal spell, the caster is able to make ferrous metal (iron, iron alloys, steel) extremely hot. Elven chain mail is not affected, and magical metal armor receives an item saving throw vs. magical fire to avoid being heated. The material component is a holy symbol.
On the first round of the spell, the metal merely becomes very warm and uncomfortable to touch (this is also the effect on the last melee round of the spell's duration). During the second and sixth (next to the last) rounds, heat causes blisters and damage; in the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal becomes searing hot, causing damage to exposed flesh, as shown below: Metal Temperature Damage per Round very warm none hot 1d4 points searing* 2d4 points * On the final round of searing, the afflicted creature must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or suffer one of the following disabilities: hand or foot--becomes unusable for 2d4 days; body--becomes disabled for 1d4 days; head--fall unconscious for 1d4 turns.
This effect can be completely removed by the 6th-level priest spell heal spell or by normal rest.
Note also that materials such as wood, leather, or flammable cloth smolder and burn if exposed to searing hot metal. Such materials cause searing damage to exposed flesh on the next round. Fire resistance (spell, potion, or ring) or a protection from fire spell totally negates the effects of a heat metal spell, as does immersion in water or snow, or exposure to a cold or ice storm spell. This version of the spell does not function under water. For every two experience levels of the caster, the metal of one man-sized creature can be affected (i.e., arms and armor, or a single mass of metal equal to 50 pounds of weight).
Thus, a 3rd-level caster would affect one such creature, a 4th- or 5th-level caster two, etc.
The reverse of the spell, chill metal, counters a heat metal spell or else causes metal to act as follows: Metal Temperature Damage per Round cold none icy 1-2 points freezing* 1d4 points * On the final round of freezing, the afflicted creature must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or suffer from the numbing effects of the cold. This causes the loss of all feeling in a hand (or hands, if the DM rules the saving throw was failed badly) for 1d4 days. During this time, the character's grip is extremely weak and he cannot use that hand for fighting or any other activity requiring a firm grasp.
The chill metal spell is countered by a resist cold spell, or by any great heat--proximity to a blazing fire (not a mere torch), a magical flaming sword, a wall of fire spell, etc.
Under water, this version of the spell inflicts no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, exerting an upward buoyancy."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell is one of the few cooperative spells that requires one priest to cast the transfer spell, but another priest to use its effect. On one round, a priest (or priests) casts the mystic transfer. The spell is then active for the remaining nine rounds of the turn.
Mystic transfer allows a priest to receive spells from another priest of the same ethos.
Any priest of the same religion can cast a spell and transfer it to a second priest within that spell's maximum range. The spell does not take effect; instead, it is channelled through the mystic transfer into the receiving priest. This priest must immediately cast the spell or pass it to another priest cloaked in a mystic transfer within the spell's range. Any number of transfers can be made in the same round, provided each new recipient is within spell range of the previous recipient. If the spell is not transferred, the spell takes effect.
For example, a 3rd-level priest casts a mystic transfer. On the following round, a 10th-level priest \"passes\" a flame strike to the 3rd-level priest. The two priests could be 60 yards apart (the maximum range of the flame strike). The 3rd-level priest could then use the flame strike to attack any target within 60 yards, or could pass the spell on to another priest who has an active mystic transfer.
The spell passed by the mystic transfer has the range, area of effect, damage, and other effects equal to the level of the original caster. In the example above, the flame strike would function as if cast by a 10th-level priest.
The mystic transfer does not require concentration. However, on any round in which a priest is receiving and/or transferring a spell, the caster cannot take any other significant action.
A priest can receive spells only from priests who worship the same deity and who specifically target spells to him. Area effect spells may be passed. A priest can never use mystic transfer to pluck an opponent's spells out of the air."}</textarea>

"description":"This cooperative spell allows the priests to create a beneficial atmosphere within a specified area. Companions of similar alignment to the casters will feel fortified and encouraged while in the sanctified area. The spell can be cast by a single priest or a group of priests.
After casting sanctify, the affected area is imbued with the deity's majesty. For followers of that deity, the area radiates a holy aura. These followers gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against all fear- and charm-based powers (a +2 to morale for BATTLESYSTEM rules units). Persons of the same alignment as the caster but of different faiths gain a +1 to saving throws (+1 in BATTLESYSTEM rules). The effect applies only as long as the characters remain in the sanctified area.
Creatures intent on harming the priest or his followers suffer a -1 on saving throws vs.
fear and charm (-1 to morale for BATTLESYSTEM rules units) when on sanctified ground.
Undead creatures within the area are easier to turn; any priest standing on sanctified ground turns undead as if he were one level higher.
Although this spell can be cast by a single priest, it is most effective when cast by several priests at once. The duration of the spell is equal to one round per level of the caster. When several priests cast the spell, the level of the most powerful priest is used, with two rounds added for every contributing priest. Thus, one 8th-level and three 6thlevel priests would give the spell a duration of 14 rounds (8+2+2+2).
Sanctify is often used in conjunction with focus to protect the grounds of a temple or encourage men defending a castle.
The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a handful of dirt from the grounds of an existing temple of the same faith.
The reverse of this spell, defile, functions in an identical manner with respect to saving throws for charm and fear. However, priests standing on defiled ground who attempt to turn undead do so at one level lower than their current level.
The material components for the reverse are the priest's holy symbol and a handful of earth from a grave."}</textarea>

"description":"When this spell is cast, all natural, undressed earth or stone in the area of effect is softened. Wet earth becomes thick mud; dry earth becomes loose sand or dirt; and stone becomes soft clay, easily molded or chopped. The priest affects a 10-foot square area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the toughness or resilience of the ground at that spot (DM option). Magical or enchanted stone cannot be affected by this spell, nor can dressed or worked stone.
Creatures attempting to move through an area softened into mud are reduced to a move of 10 feet per round. Any creatures caught within the mud when the spell takes effect must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation or lose the ability to move, attack, or cast spells for 1d2 rounds as they flounder about in the muck. Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, and creatures are only reduced to half their normal movement rate, with no chance of being caught for a round or two. However, it is impossible to run, sprint, or charge over either surface.
Restore Strength Soften Earth and Stone Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before. For example, a party of PCs trying to break out of a cavern might use this spell to soften a wall.
While soften earth and stone does not affect dressed or worked stone, vertical surfaces such as cliff faces or cavern ceilings can be affected. Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face or roof and falls. A moderate amount of structural damage can be inflicted to man-made structures by softening the ground beneath a wall or tower, causing it to settle. However, most well-built structures will only be damaged by this spell, not destroyed. The material component is a bit of slip (wet clay) from the wheel of a master potter."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell conjures a coherent pseudopod of water from any suitable body of water at least 5 feet across and 2 feet deep (for streams) or 10 feet in diameter and 2 feet deep (for ponds or pools). The pseudopod can stretch up to 10 feet plus 1 foot per caster level from its source, so a 3rd-level priest could command watery fist to strike at a creature hovering thirteen feet above a lake or standing on the shore 13 feet from the water. The pseudopod obeys the priest's mental commands, although the priest must concentrate each round in order to maintain control of the watery member.
The pseudopod is incapable of fine manipulation, but it can be used to make bludgeoning or constricting attacks. When used to strike at opponents, it attacks with the caster's THAC0 and inflicts damage as shown below. The priest may add his magical attack adjustment (from his Wisdom score) to his THAC0, but Strength-based adjustments or special weapon skills don't help the priest to control watery fist. The pseudopod may be able to make rear or flank attacks if the priest can direct it into the proper position.
If used to encircle and constrict, the pseudopod must first make an attack roll as described above, inflicting damage based on the priest's level. However, in following rounds, the pseudopod automatically strikes its grappled target for constricting damage, +1 point per round of constricting. In other words, in the first round the victim sustains listed damage, in the second round he sustains listed damage +1, in the third he sustains listed damage +2, and so on. The pseudopod holds its target with an effective Strength equal to the priest's Wisdom score.
Watery fist can be released by the priest any time he cares to stop concentrating on maintaining it. The pseudopod immediately resumes its normal state, possibly drenching a grappled creature or extinguishing a small fire if the caster wishes. The pseudopod is AC 6 and has 15 hp plus 1 hp per caster level, but it can only be damaged by magical weapons, fire, or cold; all other attacks simply pass through the water.
Transmute water to dust, part water, lower water, and Otiluke's freezing sphere all destroy watery fist on contact.
The material component is a vial full of blessed water or a sprig of mistletoe that is thrown onto the body of water from which the fist will be summoned."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell creates the lowest of the undead monsters, skeletons or zombies, usually from the bones or bodies of dead humans, demihumans, or humanoids. The spell causes these remains to become animated and obey the simple verbal commands of the caster, regardless of how they communicated in life. The skeletons or zombies can follow the caster, remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific type of creature) entering the place, etc. The undead remain animated until they are destroyed in combat or are turned; the magic cannot be dispelled.
The priest can animate one skeleton or one zombie for each experience level he has attained. If creatures with more than 1+ Hit Dice are animated, the number is determined by the monster Hit Dice. Skeletal forms have the Hit Dice of the original creature, while zombie forms have 1 more Hit Die. Thus, a 12th-level priest could animate 12 dwarven skeletons (or six zombies), four zombie gnolls, or a single zombie fire giant. Note that this is based on the standard racial Hit Die norm; thus, a high-level adventurer would be animated as a skeleton or zombie of 1 or 2 Hit Dice, and without special class or racial abilities. The caster can, alternatively, animate two small animal skeletons (1-1 Hit Die or less) for every level of experience he has achieved.
The spell requires a drop of blood, a piece of flesh of the type of creature being animated, and a pinch of bone powder or a bone shard to complete the spell. Casting this spell is not a good act, and only evil priests use it frequently."}</textarea>

By stating a subject's name, the priest may view a specific creature or object in the window. More than one subject may be viewed during the spell's duration.

The window operates from both sides; creatures in the Astral plane can see the priest as easily as he can see them. Verbal communication is not possible, however.
Normally, creatures cannot pass through the window. If an attempt is made, there is a base 5% chance of success. This is modified by +1% per level or Hit Dice of the individual. In order to pass through, the creature or object must be small enough to fit through the window; otherwise, only a portion of the subject may reach through (such as a monster's arm or searching tongue).

Creatures with penalties in bright light suffer them in this spell's area of effect. As with the light spell, this can be cast into the air, onto an object, or at a creature. In the third case, the continual light affects the space about 1 foot behind a creature that successfully rolls its saving throw vs.
spell (a failed saving throw means the continual light is centered on the creature and moves as it moves). Note that this spell also blinds a creature if it is successfully cast upon the creature's visual organs. If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed in a light-proof covering, the spell effects are blocked until the covering is removed.
Continual light brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) cancels the darkness so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. A direct casting of a continual light spell against a similar or weaker magical darkness cancels both.
This spell eventually consumes the material it is cast upon, but the process takes far longer than the time in a typical campaign. Extremely hard and expensive materials might last hundreds or even thousands of years.
The reverse spell, continual darkness, causes complete absence of light (pitch blackness), similar to the darkness spell but of greater duration and area."}</textarea>

Extremely hard and expensive materials might last hundreds or even thousands of years.<br />The reverse spell, continual darkness, causes complete absence of light (pitch blackness), similar to the darkness spell but of greater duration and area.</div>

"description":"With this spell, the caster generates a squadron of tiny invisible servants who create a campsite for the caster and his companions. The caster indicates the desired area for the campsite (an area of 50-foot radius or less) and the number of persons the campsite is to accommodate (a number of persons equal to three times the level of the caster).
The servants clear the area of debris, set up tents and bedrolls, start a campfire, fetch water, and prepare a bland meal. The campsite is so skillfully prepared that it blends with the surrounding terrain, reducing the chance that the camp could be noticed by 50%.
Campfires, loud noises, and other activities can negate this.
The entire process takes 4-16 (4d4) rounds to complete.
The servants make camp with the gear and equipment provided for them; otherwise, the servants will improvise with materials available in the immediate area (50 yards of the designated campsite). For instance, if the party has no tents or beds, the servants will construct crude but comfortable beds of weeds and grass and temporary shelters of leaves and branches. If no materials are available, such as in the desert or similarly barren terrain, the servants will do their best to make the party as comfortable as possible within the environmental limitations.
The servants cannot fight for the party, deliver messages, or take any other actions other than creating the campsite.
The material components are a piece of string, a bit of wood, and a drop of water.
The reverse, break camp, causes the invisible servants to strike a campsite (an area of 50-foot radius or less). The servants extinguish fires, dispose of debris, and pack gear for a number of people equal to three times the level of the caster. The entire process takes 4- 16 (4d4) rounds to complete. When completed, all traces of the campsite are eliminated.
The material components are the same as those for create campsite."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell enables the caster to cure most diseases by placing his hand upon the diseased creature. The affliction rapidly disappears thereafter, making the cured creature whole and well in from one turn to 10 days, depending on the type of disease and the state of its advancement when the cure took place. (The DM must adjudicate these conditions.) The spell is also effective against parasitic monsters such as green slime, rot grubs, and others. When cast by a priest of at least 12th level, this spell cures lycanthropy if cast within three days of the infection. Note that the spell does not prevent reoccurrence of a disease if the recipient is again exposed.
The reverse of the cure disease spell is cause disease. To be effective, the priest must touch the intended victim, and the victim must fail a saving throw vs. spell. The severity of the disease is decided by the priest (debilitating or fatal). The exact details of the disease are decided by the DM, but the following are typical: Debilitating: The disease takes effect in 1d6 turns, after which the creature loses 1 point of Strength per hour until his Strength is reduced to 2 or less, at which time the recipient is weak and virtually helpless. If a creature has no Strength rating, it loses 10% of its hit points per Strength loss, down to 10% of its original hit points. If the disease also affects hit points, use the more severe penalty. Recovery requires a period of 1d3 weeks.
Fatal: This wasting disease is effective immediately. Infected creatures receive no benefit from cure wound spells while the disease is in effect; wounds heal at only 10% of the natural rate. The disease proves fatal within 1d6 months and can be cured only by magical means. Each month the disease progresses, the creature loses 2 points of Charisma, permanently.
The inflicted disease can be cured by the cure disease spell. Lycanthropy cannot be caused."}</textarea>

"description":"When a priest casts this spell, it has a chance to neutralize or negate the magic it comes in contact with as follows: First, it has a chance to remove spells and spell-like effects (including device effects and innate abilities) from creatures or objects. Second, it may disrupt the casting or use of these in the area of effect at the instant the dispel is cast. Third, it may destroy magical potions (which are treated as 12th level for purposes of this spell).
Each effect or potion in the spell's area is checked to determine if it is dispelled. The caster can always dispel his own magic; otherwise, the chance depends on the difference in level between the magical effect and the caster. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 11 or higher on 1d20. If the caster is of higher level than the creator of the effect to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted from this base number needed. If the caster is of lower level, the difference is added to the base. A die roll of 20 always succeeds and a die roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic he is trying to dispel, only a roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dispelled.
A dispel magic can affect only a specially enchanted item (such as a magical scroll, ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous item, weapon, shield, or armor) if it is cast directly upon the item. This renders the item nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An item possessed or carried by a creature has the creature's saving throw against this effect; otherwise, it is automatically rendered nonoperational. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) rendered nonoperational is temporarily closed. Note that an item's physical properties are unchanged: A nonoperational magical sword is still a sword.
Artifacts and relics are not subject to this spell, but some of their spell-like effects may be, at the DM's option.
Note that this spell, if successful, will release charmed and similarly beguiled creatures. Certain spells or effects cannot be dispelled; these are listed in the spell descriptions.

"description":"This spell can be cast in one of two ways: in a manner that affects the priest, or in a manner that affects a subject other than the priest.
The first method affects only the priest and allows him to shield his true emotions from magical examination. Thus, it can block wizard spells such as ESP or priest spells such as emotion read. While emotion control is in effect, anyone using one of these spells will sense the emotion designated by the priest rather than his true emotions. When the priest casts emotion control, he designates the false emotion he wishes to be revealed.
This use of emotion control also gives the priest a +2 bonus to saving throws against the following spells: spook, taunt, irritation, know alignment, scare, emotion, fear, and phantasmal killer. When any of these spells are cast on the priest, he is immediately aware of the attempt, although he does not learn the source of the spell.
If another character casts emotion read, ESP, or a similar spell on the priest, the priest must make a saving throw vs. spells with a +1 bonus for each 5 levels of the priest. If the priest successfully saves, the other spellcaster reads the false emotion; if the priest fails the saving throw, the spellcaster reads the priest's true emotion.
The second use of this spell allows the priest to create a single emotional reaction in the subject(s) (similar to the wizard spell emotion). Some typical emotions follow, but the DM may allow other similar effects.
Courage: The subject becomes berserk, gaining +1 to attack rolls and +3 to damage, and temporarily gaining 4 hit points (damage against the subject is deducted from these temporary points first). The subject need never check morale, and receives a +5 bonus to saving throws against the various forms of fear. Courage counters (and is countered by) fear.
Fear: The subject flees from the priest for the duration of the spell, even if this takes him out of spell range. Fear counters (and is countered by) courage.
Friendship: The subject reacts positively to any encounter; in game terms, any result of a roll on the Encounter Reactions table (Table 59 in the DMG ) is moved one column to the left. Thus, a threatening PC becomes cautious, an indifferent PC becomes friendly, etc. Friendship counters (and is countered by) hate.
Happiness: The subject experiences feelings of warmth, well-being, and confidence, modifying all reaction rolls by +3. The subject is unlikely to attack unless provoked.
Happiness counters (and is countered by) sadness.
Hate: The subject reacts negatively to any encounter; in game terms, any result of a roll on the Encounter Reactions table is moved one column to the right (i.e., a friendly PC becomes indifferent, a cautious PC becomes threatening, etc.). Hate counters (and is countered by) friendship.
Hope: The subject's morale is improved by +2. His saving throw rolls, attack, and damage rolls are all improved by +1 while this emotion is in effect. Hope counters (and is countered by) hopelessness.
Hopelessness: The subject's morale suffers a -10 penalty. In addition, in the round in which the emotion is initially established, all subjects must immediately make a morale check. Hopelessness counters (and is countered by) hope.
Sadness: The subject feels uncontrollably glum and is prone to fits of morose introspection. All attack rolls suffer a -1 penalty and initiative rolls suffer a +1 penalty.
The subject's chance of being surprised is increased by -2. Sadness counters (and is countered by) happiness.
All subjects of the second version, even willing targets, must save vs. spell to resist the emotion. In addition to all other modifiers, the saving throw is modified by -1 for every three levels of the priest casting the spell.
The material component for both versions of the spell is a small bunch of fleece or uncarded wool that is consumed in the casting."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">This spell can be cast in one of two ways: in a manner that affects the priest, or in a manner that affects a subject other than the priest.<br />The first method affects only the priest and allows him to shield his true emotions from magical examination. Thus, it can block wizard spells such as ESP or priest spells such as emotion read. While emotion control is in effect, anyone using one of these spells will sense the emotion designated by the priest rather than his true emotions. When the priest casts emotion control, he designates the false emotion he wishes to be revealed.<br />This use of emotion control also gives the priest a +2 bonus to saving throws against the following spells: spook, taunt, irritation, know alignment, scare, emotion, fear, and phantasmal killer. When any of these spells are cast on the priest, he is immediately aware of the attempt, although he does not learn the source of the spell.<br />If another character casts emotion read, ESP, or a similar spell on the priest, the priest must make a saving throw vs. spells with a +1 bonus for each 5 levels of the priest. If the priest successfully saves, the other spellcaster reads the false emotion; if the priest fails the saving throw, the spellcaster reads the priest&#039;s true emotion.<br />The second use of this spell allows the priest to create a single emotional reaction in the subject(s) (similar to the wizard spell emotion). Some typical emotions follow, but the DM may allow other similar effects.<br />Courage: The subject becomes berserk, gaining +1 to attack rolls and +3 to damage, and temporarily gaining 4 hit points (damage against the subject is deducted from these temporary points first). The subject need never check morale, and receives a +5 bonus to saving throws against the various forms of fear. Courage counters (and is countered by) fear.<br />Fear: The subject flees from the priest for the duration of the spell, even if this takes him out of spell range. Fear counters (and is countered by) courage.<br />Friendship: The subject reacts positively to any encounter; in game terms, any result of a roll on the Encounter Reactions table (Table 59 in the DMG ) is moved one column to the left. Thus, a threatening PC becomes cautious, an indifferent PC becomes friendly, etc. Friendship counters (and is countered by) hate.<br />Happiness: The subject experiences feelings of warmth, well-being, and confidence, modifying all reaction rolls by +3. The subject is unlikely to attack unless provoked.<br />Happiness counters (and is countered by) sadness.<br />Hate: The subject reacts negatively to any encounter; in game terms, any result of a roll on the Encounter Reactions table is moved one column to the right (i.e., a friendly PC becomes indifferent, a cautious PC becomes threatening, etc.). Hate counters (and is countered by) friendship.<br />Hope: The subject&#039;s morale is improved by +2. His saving throw rolls, attack, and damage rolls are all improved by +1 while this emotion is in effect. Hope counters (and is countered by) hopelessness.<br />Hopelessness: The subject&#039;s morale suffers a -10 penalty. In addition, in the round in which the emotion is initially established, all subjects must immediately make a morale check. Hopelessness counters (and is countered by) hope.<br />Sadness: The subject feels uncontrollably glum and is prone to fits of morose introspection. All attack rolls suffer a -1 penalty and initiative rolls suffer a +1 penalty.<br />The subject&#039;s chance of being surprised is increased by -2. Sadness counters (and is countered by) happiness.<br />All subjects of the second version, even willing targets, must save vs. spell to resist the emotion. In addition to all other modifiers, the saving throw is modified by -1 for every three levels of the priest casting the spell.<br />The material component for both versions of the spell is a small bunch of fleece or uncarded wool that is consumed in the casting.</div>

"description":"This spell resembles the 5th-level wizard spell etherealness in many respects, but there are a few important differences. First, the priest may not leave the Border Ethereal and venture into the Deep Ethereal; therefore, at the end of the spell's duration, he must return to the Prime Material Plane whether he wants to or not. Secondly, the priest may not use this spell on an unwilling target and can only make another creature ethereal if the subject is willing and in physical contact with the priest when the spell is cast. Besides himself, the caster can bring one creature per two experience levels (three at 5th, four at 7th, five at 9th, and so on) to the Ethereal Plane. Even if the priest abandons his charges in the Border Ethereal, the stranded characters will automatically materialize when the spell ends.
While ethereal, the priest cannot be detected by any means short of a true seeing or detect phase spell. He perceives his surroundings as misty, gray, and otherworldly. No action he takes can affect the physical world, but he can pass through walls, doors, and other solid objects without hindrance. The priest can choose to end the spell voluntarily at any time, materializing in the physical world in one round.

When cast upon a victim who has been poisoned by any means, hold poison arrests the venom and prevents it from doing any additional damage to the victim.

Damage that has already been inflicted is not restored, but as long as the hold poison is in effect, the victim can be cured or healed of damage caused by poison by any normal means.
This spell can be used to indefinitely postpone the onset of a poison if the caster chooses to continue to cast it on the poisoned character before the previous hold poison wears off. However, each time a new hold poison is used to stop the venom's advance for another few days, there is a 2% cumulative chance that the spell fails and the poison runs Hold Poison its course. Evil priests have been known to deliberately poison a person and then use this spell to grant the victim a stay of death for a few days. This can be an extremely effective threat if the victim doesn't have access to a neutralize poison spell.
The material component is the priest's holy symbol and a bud of garlic, crushed and smeared on the injury (or eaten if the poison was ingested)."}</textarea>

Evil priests have been known to deliberately poison a person and then use this spell to grant the victim a stay of death for a few days. This can be an extremely effective threat if the victim doesn&#039;t have access to a neutralize poison spell.<br />The material component is the priest&#039;s holy symbol and a bud of garlic, crushed and smeared on the injury (or eaten if the poison was ingested).</div>

"description":"A pyrotechnics spell draws on an existing fire source to produce either of two effects, at the option of the caster.
First, it can produce a flashing and fiery burst of glowing, colored aerial fireworks that lasts one round. Creatures in, under, or within 120 feet of the area that have an unobstructed line of sight to the effect are blinded for 1d4+1 rounds unless they roll successful saving throws vs. spell. The fireworks fill a volume 10 times greater than the original fire source.
Second, it can cause a thick, writhing stream of smoke to arise from the source and form a choking cloud that lasts for one round per experience level of the caster. This covers a roughly hemispherical volume from the ground or floor up (or conforming to the shape of a confined area) that totally obscures vision beyond 2 feet. The smoke fills a volume 100 times that of the fire source.
The spell uses one fire source within the area of effect, which is immediately extinguished. If an extremely large fire is used as the source, it is only partially extinguished by the casting. Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based creature (such as a fire elemental) used as a source suffers 1d4 points of damage, plus 1 point of damage per caster level.

				<div class="description-content">A pyrotechnics spell draws on an existing fire source to produce either of two effects, at the option of the caster.<br />First, it can produce a flashing and fiery burst of glowing, colored aerial fireworks that lasts one round. Creatures in, under, or within 120 feet of the area that have an unobstructed line of sight to the effect are blinded for 1d4+1 rounds unless they roll successful saving throws vs. spell. The fireworks fill a volume 10 times greater than the original fire source.<br />Second, it can cause a thick, writhing stream of smoke to arise from the source and form a choking cloud that lasts for one round per experience level of the caster. This covers a roughly hemispherical volume from the ground or floor up (or conforming to the shape of a confined area) that totally obscures vision beyond 2 feet. The smoke fills a volume 100 times that of the fire source.<br />The spell uses one fire source within the area of effect, which is immediately extinguished. If an extremely large fire is used as the source, it is only partially extinguished by the casting. Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based creature (such as a fire elemental) used as a source suffers 1d4 points of damage, plus 1 point of damage per caster level. This spell does not function under water.</div>

"description":"Upon casting this spell, the priest is usually able to remove a curse on an object, on a person, or in the form of some undesired sending or evil presence. Note that the remove curse spell does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, for example, although the spell typically enables the person afflicted with any such cursed item to get rid of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell, or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or more. A caster of 12th level or more can cure lycanthropy with this spell by casting it on the animal form. The were-creature receives a saving throw vs. spell and, if successful, the spell fails and the priest must gain a level before attempting the remedy on this creature again.
The reverse of the spell is not permanent; the bestow curse spell lasts for one turn for every experience level of the priest using the spell. The curse can have one of the following effects (roll percentile dice): 50% of the time it reduces one ability of the victim to 3 (the DM randomly determines which ability); 25% of the time it lowers the victim's attack and saving throw rolls by -4; 25% of the time it makes the victim 50% likely to drop whatever he is holding (or do nothing, in the case of creatures not using tools)--roll each round.
It is possible for a priest to devise his own curse, and it should be similar in power to those given here. Consult your DM. The subject of a bestow curse spell must be touched.
If the victim is touched, a saving throw is still applicable; if it is successful, the effect is negated. The bestowed curse cannot be dispelled.
Example of Dwarven Curse forged into armor: Non dwarven thanes who wear this armor lose 1 point of con per week or fraction thereof. Theft of armor applies as well. Beards will fall out over time.
Example of Dwarven Cruse forged into weapons: 50% chance to drop the weapon each round if wielded by a non-dwarf. Fumbled weapons are useless and always dropped, even if it is picked up again."}</textarea>

"description":"Repair injury is intended for use in campaigns featuring the critical hit or critical strike rules. This spell addresses one specific injury or wound (see Chapter 8). It can be used to knit a broken bone, alleviate the swelling and pain of a sprain or a twist, or repair soft-tissue damage such as an injured eye, ear, or a severed tendon. If used as a simple curing spell, repair injury restores 1d10+1 hit points to the injured character, but if used to address the effects of a specific injury, repair injury automatically removes one grazed, struck, injured, or broken condition, and alleviates any combat, movement, or maximum hit point penalties associated with the injury in question. The spell does not restore any lost hit points to the victim, other than the 1d10+1 that are incidental to the working of the spell.
Beran, a fighter with 44 hit points, is struck by an ogre's club. The blow inflicts 12 points of damage, but Beran also suffers a broken hip. This injury will reduce him to a maximum of 25% of his normal total, so Beran's current hit points drop from 32 to 11 after the battle ends. In addition, he is not capable of moving or attacking due to the effects of the injury.
When the smoke clears, Talmos the priest comes to Beran's aid. Using repair injury, he knits Beran's broken hip. The spell cures 6 hit points in the process. Beran no longer suffers the movement or attack penalties for a broken hip and has 17 hit points to his credit. With time or additional healing, he can regain his normal total of 44.
Repair injury is also helpful in dealing with wounds that fall in the crushed, shattered, or destroyed category. This spell reduces the severity of the injury to the broken level, which means it heals as if it were 20d6 lost hit points. Only one repair injury can be used on any given wound, so a character with a shattered knee could still require a lot of time to recover after an application of this spell.
Severed limbs, destroyed eyes or ears, and ability score losses caused by injuries cannot be healed by this spell. Repair injury is the equivalent of cure serious wounds for the purpose of slowing or stopping bleeding."}</textarea>

While stone coffers can be thus formed, stone doors made, etc., the fineness of detail is not great. If the shaping has moving parts, there is a 30% chance they do not work.<br />The material component of this spell is soft clay that must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object, and then touched to the stone when the spell is uttered.</div>

"description":"This spell establishes direct, two-way mental contact between the priest and a single subject. The subject must have Intelligence of at least 5 for the spell to take effect. While the spell is in effect, the two participants can communicate silently and rapidly, regardless of whether they share a common language.

Telepathy does not give either participant access to the other's thoughts, memories, or emotions. Participants can only \"hear\" the thoughts that the other participant actively \"sends.\" Mind-to-mind communication is approximately four times faster than verbal communication. The level of complexity that can be communicated is only that which can be expressed through language. Gestures, expressions, and body language cannot be conveyed.

A priest can establish separate \"telepathic channels\" to multiple individuals. Each linkage is established through a separate casting of the spell. There is no network between the channels. For example, Balfas the priest establishes telepathy with Alra the warrior and Zymor the thief by casting this spell twice. Balfas can communicate a single thought to both Alra and Zymor, but Alra and Zymor cannot communicate with each other. Balfas, however, can \"target\" a thought so that only one of the two participants receives it.

If the priest casts this spell on an unwilling subject (for example, if the priest wants to silently threaten or taunt the subject), the subject receives a saving throw vs. spell to resist the effect. Willing subjects need not make a saving throw.

Lead sheeting of more than _ \" thickness will totally block telepathy."}</textarea>

For example, if the priest was about to open a trapped chest, the unfailing premonition would create a flash of insight or a gut feeling telling him that he shouldn't do so.
Similarly, opening a door that leads into the lair of a ferocious troll may also trigger the spell's warning. Threatening a NPC who is likely to respond by drawing a weapon and attacking the PC would create a warning, but threatening a NPC who will get even with the priest in an hour or two will not trigger the premonition.
The unfailing premonition is also quite useful in combat, as long as the priest obeys his instincts and ducks, dodges, or withdraws when his subconscious tells him to.
While the spell is in effect, the priest gains a +2 bonus to his Armor Class and saving throws, but in any given round there is a 25% chance that he will have to forego his intended action in order to obey the spell's warning impulses.
The premonition only works on actions undertaken by the priest himself. If his companion is about to pull a mysterious lever that will drop a 10-ton block of stone on the priest, he receives no warning."}</textarea>

Generally, the priest is limited to one discrete action per round since he must focus his wind servant tightly on any given task. The wind servant can affect objects or creatures weighing up to 1 pound per caster level, twice as much if the object is reasonably light or airy (a cloak, scroll, or haystack, for instance), or 10 times as much if the object is designed to be carried by the wind, such as a ship's sail or a bird in flight.
If an object is within the spell's weight limit, the caster may direct the wind servant to carry it along in gusts and air currents at a flying movement rate of 12 (E). If the object leaves the limits of the spell's range, the wind servant fails, and the object drops or falls normally from that point. Flying creatures of size M or smaller can be forced to land or be driven away by use of the spell if they fall within the weight limit, or slowed by 50% if they exceed the weight limit.

In dusty, snowy, or sandy regions, the caster can instead use wind servant to create a vicious zephyr of stinging dust around an enemy. This zephyr inflicts damage equal to the opponent's base AC less 2d6 points and creates a -2 penalty to the victim's attack rolls. For example, an enemy in leather armor +1 (AC 7) would suffer 7 - 2d6 damage if attacked by means of this spell.

"description":"This spell creates the necessary conditions for devotional energy to be used. For faith magic to work, the priest must create a focus to harness the necessary devotional energy.
This spell creates that focus. A focus cannot function without a source of devotional energy.
The focus gathers devotional energy and reshapes it in order to amplify other spells cast by the priest (or priests). The same energy keeps the focus in existence. If the spell is cast and there is no immediate source of devotional energy within 100 feet, the focus immediately fails.
Once created, most foci cannot be moved. This condition and the need for a constant supply of devotional energy tends to limit the use of foci to temples, churches, monasteries, shrines, and seminaries--permanent structures where followers of the religion gather on a regular basis. Sometimes a focus is created for a special gathering such as a holy day, conclave, grand wedding, or yearly festival.
Not all foci are identical. The particular form of the focus depends on the power and nature of the spell being amplified. All foci can be seen by detect magic. There are three basic types of foci: site, item, and living.
Site foci are connected to a place, whether a room, building, field, or forest. Once cast, the foci cannot be moved. It causes no disturbance in the surroundings; it is invisible and intangible.
Item foci are centered on a single object. Customarily, this object is large and immovable, such as an altar, but it is possible for the focus to be as small as is practical.
The item can be as elaborate or plain as desired, but should have some significance to the religion.
Living foci are the rarest of all types. In this case, the focus is created on a living plant, animal, or person. Detect charm reveals the person is somehow enchanted, although not under the influence of a typical charm spell.
The type of focus created (site, item, or living) depends on the religion and nature of the spell amplified. These choices are listed in Table 3: Focused Spell Effects.
Casting the focus spell is a long and complicated process, accompanied by many ceremonies and rituals. During the day spent casting the spell, the priest will need the assistance of at least two other priests of the same faith. These aides need not memorize the spell (or even be capable of casting it). Their duty is to provide the extra hands and voices needed at specific points of the casting. A large number of worshipers must also be present since the focus requires their energy. Not surprisingly, the casting of this spell is often incorporated into important holy festivals or special occasions.
The duration of the focus is one year. If the devotional energy falls below a minimum level, the spell ends sooner. A focus requires the devotional energy of at least 100 devout worshipers. Lay monks (those dedicated to the religion but not priests) count as two worshipers, while priests (of any level) count as ten. A focus could be maintained by a congregation of 100, a monastery of fifty, or a seminary of as few as 10 priests (or any combination of the above). The focus must receive this energy for at least 10 hours out of every day. If these conditions are not met, the focus weakens. The area of effect of the amplified spell decreases by 20% each day until it fades away completely.
Once the focus is created, the priest or priests have 1 turn in which to cast the desired spell upon the focus. A focus can amplify only one spell, and each item, creature, or place can receive only one focus. Spells that can be cast upon a focus are listed on Table 3.
Table 3: FOCUSED SPELL EFFECTS Possible Focus Spell Type Anti-animal shell S/I/L Anti-plant shell S/I/L Bless S/I Control temperature, 10' radius S* Control winds S/I* Cure disease I/L Cure blindness or deafness I/L Detect poison S/I Detect lie I Detect magic I Dispel evil S/I Endure cold/endure heat S* Know alignment I/L Negative plane protection S/I Protection from evil S/I Protection from lightning S Protections from fire S Purify food and drink I Remove fear S/I/L Remove curse I Repel insects S/I Resist fire/resist cold S Speak with animals S/I/L Tongues S/I True seeing S * The caster must state a desired range (temperature, wind strength, etc.) within the spell's normal limitations at the time it is cast.
Once the spell is cast, the normal duration and area of effect for that spell are ignored.
The focus begins to increase these factors of the spell's power. After one day, the amplified spell reaches its full area of effect. Thereafter, it remains over that area until the focus fails.
The area affected by the focus (and its amplified spell) depends on the level of the caster. The spell expands in a radius from the focus, 20 feet per level of the caster, although it can deliberately be created smaller. Within that area of effect, the amplified spell exerts its normal effect. A 13th-level priest could create a focus up to 260 feet in diameter.
The material components are many, including special vestments, incense, oils, waters, and other equipment the DM deems appropriate. The cost of these materials is never less than 1,000 gp plus 100 gp per level of spell being amplified. These items are given up as offerings to the deity (perhaps to be distributed to the poor), and new ones must be obtained each time the spell is cast."}</textarea>

Sometimes a focus is created for a special gathering such as a holy day, conclave, grand wedding, or yearly festival.<br />Not all foci are identical. The particular form of the focus depends on the power and nature of the spell being amplified. All foci can be seen by detect magic. There are three basic types of foci: site, item, and living.<br />Site foci are connected to a place, whether a room, building, field, or forest. Once cast, the foci cannot be moved. It causes no disturbance in the surroundings; it is invisible and intangible.<br />Item foci are centered on a single object. Customarily, this object is large and immovable, such as an altar, but it is possible for the focus to be as small as is practical.<br />The item can be as elaborate or plain as desired, but should have some significance to the religion.<br />Living foci are the rarest of all types. In this case, the focus is created on a living plant, animal, or person. Detect charm reveals the person is somehow enchanted, although not under the influence of a typical charm spell.<br />The type of focus created (site, item, or living) depends on the religion and nature of the spell amplified. These choices are listed in Table 3: Focused Spell Effects.<br />Casting the focus spell is a long and complicated process, accompanied by many ceremonies and rituals. During the day spent casting the spell, the priest will need the assistance of at least two other priests of the same faith. These aides need not memorize the spell (or even be capable of casting it). Their duty is to provide the extra hands and voices needed at specific points of the casting. A large number of worshipers must also be present since the focus requires their energy. Not surprisingly, the casting of this spell is often incorporated into important holy festivals or special occasions.<br />The duration of the focus is one year. If the devotional energy falls below a minimum level, the spell ends sooner. A focus requires the devotional energy of at least 100 devout worshipers. Lay monks (those dedicated to the religion but not priests) count as two worshipers, while priests (of any level) count as ten. A focus could be maintained by a congregation of 100, a monastery of fifty, or a seminary of as few as 10 priests (or any combination of the above). The focus must receive this energy for at least 10 hours out of every day. If these conditions are not met, the focus weakens. The area of effect of the amplified spell decreases by 20% each day until it fades away completely.<br />Once the focus is created, the priest or priests have 1 turn in which to cast the desired spell upon the focus. A focus can amplify only one spell, and each item, creature, or place can receive only one focus. Spells that can be cast upon a focus are listed on Table 3.<br />Table 3: FOCUSED SPELL EFFECTS Possible Focus Spell Type Anti-animal shell S/I/L Anti-plant shell S/I/L Bless S/I Control temperature, 10&#039; radius S* Control winds S/I* Cure disease I/L Cure blindness or deafness I/L Detect poison S/I Detect lie I Detect magic I Dispel evil S/I Endure cold/endure heat S* Know alignment I/L Negative plane protection S/I Protection from evil S/I Protection from lightning S Protections from fire S Purify food and drink I Remove fear S/I/L Remove curse I Repel insects S/I Resist fire/resist cold S Speak with animals S/I/L Tongues S/I True seeing S * The caster must state a desired range (temperature, wind strength, etc.) within the spell&#039;s normal limitations at the time it is cast.<br />Once the spell is cast, the normal duration and area of effect for that spell are ignored.<br />The focus begins to increase these factors of the spell&#039;s power. After one day, the amplified spell reaches its full area of effect. Thereafter, it remains over that area until the focus fails.<br />The area affected by the focus (and its amplified spell) depends on the level of the caster. The spell expands in a radius from the focus, 20 feet per level of the caster, although it can deliberately be created smaller. Within that area of effect, the amplified spell exerts its normal effect. A 13th-level priest could create a focus up to 260 feet in diameter.<br />The material components are many, including special vestments, incense, oils, waters, and other equipment the DM deems appropriate. The cost of these materials is never less than 1,000 gp plus 100 gp per level of spell being amplified. These items are given up as offerings to the deity (perhaps to be distributed to the poor), and new ones must be obtained each time the spell is cast.</div>

This spell gives the priest no access to the subject's thoughts, memory, or sensory apparatus. Thus, the priest cannot see through the subject's eyes. To control the subject, the priest must be within the range of the spell and must be able to see the subject.

At 11th level or higher, however, this restriction is removed. The priest could thus force a thief to pick a lock. Any such delicate actions suffer a -15% penalty (or -3 on 1d20) to reflect the \"remote control\" nature of the action.

Though it lasts only a single round (unless it ignites additional flammable material), the fire produced by the spell inflicts 1d4 points of damage plus 1 point per caster level (1d4 + 1/level) upon creatures within its area. It ignites combustible materials, such as cloth, oil, paper, parchment, wood, and the like, so as to cause continued burning.<br />The reverse, quench fire, extinguishes any normal fire (coals, oil, tallow, wax, wood, etc.) within the area of effect.<br />The material component for either version is a paste of sulfur and wax, formed into a ball and thrown at the target.</div>

"description":"By using this spell, the caster can place one willing subject in a state of suspended animation. The victim's breathing, heartbeat, and other vital processes slow to the point of nonexistence, although he or she seems to be deeply asleep, not dead. A caster of 7th to 10th level can maintain the suspended animation for up to one week plus one day per level; a caster of 11th to 15th level can maintain the state for up to one month plus one week per level; and a caster of 16th level or higher can place someone in suspended animation for one year plus one month per level.
This spell has many useful applications. First, all bodily or mental afflictions become quiescent during the victim's slumber. Poison, insanity, and many curses (lycanthropy, geas, and mummy rot included) can be arrested, if not cured, and have no effect on the subject while he sleeps. Of course, if the spell is broken prematurely, all the conditions that were halted by the spell will start once again. Second, the subject requires no food or water, but he still needs air and dies if deprived of oxygen. Third, for every month that the subject is in suspended animation, he recovers one hit point.
The caster can awaken the subject at any time within the spell's duration, although he must be in the subject's presence to do so. Optionally, the priest may pre-specify an amount of time within his normal duration or a special condition to awaken the sleeper. A condition must include a physical stimulus to the subject, such as a change in temperature, the touch of the sun, the kiss of a princess, or whatever the priest desires. If the priest maintaining the spell dies or is not able to awaken the sleeper, then the subject can be taken to another priest of the same deity to be awakened.
If the subject is attacked, he is completely helpless and can be killed by a single blow. However, if the subject is attacked without being slain for some reason, he gains a saving throw vs. spell each round to emerge from his suspended animation. The subject will be extremely groggy and disoriented if his slumber is disturbed in this fashion, suffering a -2 penalty to all die rolls for 1d6 turns, but if he awakens in the normal or prescribed fashion, he is disoriented for only one round.
Some of the drawbacks to this spell affect the casting priest. First of all, it takes all of the priest's concentration to cast and maintain this spell. This means that the priest cannot cast any other spell while a subject is being held under the influence of the suspended animation. For each week that the subject is in suspended animation, the priest loses one point of Constitution. This happens each week until the priest transfers the spell to another priest of the same alignment. Transferring this spell requires a successful saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw is successful, then the priest who transfers the spell can start recovering Constitution at a rate of one point per hour of bedrest. If the saving throw doesn't succeed, then the priest loses another point of Constitution and cannot try to transfer the spell again for 8 hours. Either way, because of the temporary lapse of the spell, the subject will automatically lose 1 hit point each time a transfer is attempted.
The material component for this spell is a rare herb that must be prepared with exacting care. The treatment costs at least 200 gold pieces and requires 1d3 days of the priest's time and attention."}</textarea>

Everyone who senses these thoughts, on the other hand, knows their source.
This spell causes the broadcast of only surface thoughts and motivations, not memories. There is no need for a common language between broadcaster and receivers; for this purpose, thoughts are considered to be symbolic, not dependent on language. The detail level of the thoughts is insufficient for others to learn specific skills from the subject. Thus, if the subject casts a spell, everyone within range knows what spell is being cast before it takes effect, but no one learns any knowledge about how the spell is cast.
If the broadcaster is invisible or hiding in shadows, the broadcast functions normally, and all receivers are aware that someone is in the vicinity whom they cannot see. While receivers cannot pinpoint the broadcaster's location, the broadcaster's thoughts will inevitably reveal his general position (\"Oh no, he's looking right at me,\" etc.). A character hiding in shadows will be automatically detected, while attacks against an invisible broadcaster suffer a -2 penalty, rather than the normal -4. This spell totally negates the chance of surprise by the broadcaster.
The subject must have an Intelligence score of 1 or more to become a broadcaster, and must have a \"normal\" mind as understood by PCs. Thoughts that are broadcast can be received only by individuals with Intelligence scores of 3 or better. An unwilling subject receives a normal saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effects. A willing subject can waive this saving throw.
The material component is small balloon that the priest inflates upon casting. This balloon is consumed in the casting."}</textarea>

When the spell is cast, the log sprouts four wooden, horselike legs. The tree steed may be ridden like a normal horse and may be used to carry equipment. The tree steed can carry up to 600 pounds of riders and gear before breaking. If the tree steed breaks under the weight of the riders or gear, the enchantment instantly ends and the tree steed again becomes a normal (although broken) log or plank.
The tree steed obeys all of the caster's verbal commands to move, slow, speed up, stop, and turn. It has a movement rate of 12 on land. It can move in the water (Sw 6), floating on the surface and paddling with its legs. The tree steed must remain within 10 yards of the caster in order to move; if the distance between the tree steed and the caster exceeds 10 yards, the tree steed stops until the caster is again within range.
The tree steed will not fight for the caster and is incapable of any action other than movement. The tree steed does not become fatigued and does not eat. It has all the vulnerabilities of normal wood, including fire, and can be damaged by both magical and physical attacks. It has AC 8 and 20 hit points.
The material components are a log or plank of suitable size and a horseshoe."}</textarea>

"description":"Uplift bestows increased spellcasting ability on one priest, including additional spells per level and use of spells beyond the caster's normal level. This cooperative spell requires two priests who must spend the day casting this spell. During the casting, the priests must decide which additional spells (of all levels) are desired. Upon completion of the casting, the priests touch palms, and the priest of higher level receives a charge of magical energy. This charge temporarily boosts the level of the priest for spellcasting purposes. The amount of increase is one level per five levels of the lower level caster (fractions rounded up). If both priests are of equal level, the casters must decide who benefits from the spell.
The spell grants the priest the spellcasting ability of the new level. It does not improve hit points, attack rolls, or other abilities. If the increase allows more spells per level, the additional spells are instantly placed in the character's memory. A priest is also enabled to cast spells normally beyond his level. Range, duration, area of effect, and other variables are all based on the character's temporary level.
The increased effect lasts only 1 turn. At the end of the turn, all additional spells are lost and the character reverts to his normal level.
As an example, consider a party with a fallen comrade. The two priests in the party are 7th and 8th level, both unable to cast raise dead. After a night's rest, each priest adds uplift to his memorized spells. After casting the spell, the 8th-level priest suddenly gains the casting abilities of a 10th-level priest, including the ability to cast raise dead. At the end of one turn, the priest's abilities revert to 8th-level.
Casting this spell is an arduous task, causing a severe drain on the priests. When the spell expires, the uplifted character suffers 2d6 points of damage from mental exhaustion.
This damage cannot be healed by any means until the character has had at least eight hours of rest.
The material components are the priests' holy symbols and an offering worth at least 500 gp from each priest."}</textarea>

For example, weather stasis is cast in an area where the temperature is 75 F. and no precipitation is falling. Half an hour later, the temperature drops to 60 degrees and rain begins to fall. The protected area remains dry and the temperature stays at 75 degrees. If the spell had been cast while rain was falling in the area of effect, rain would continue to fall for the duration of the spell, even after it stopped raining in the surrounding area.
All physical objects other than rain, snow, and hail can pass into the protected area.
All creatures and characters can move freely into and out of the area. The spell does not prevent water-based spells or water-based creatures (such as water elementals) from operating in the area.
The spell protects against both natural and magically generated weather. Night and day pass normally in the protected area, although temperature variations associated with night and day do not occur.

If windborne is cast by a priest on level ground, the initial gust carries him aloft to a maximum altitude of 10 feet per caster level. From that point, he may then glide 10 feet per foot of initial altitude. For example, a 7th-level priest would ascend to an altitude of 70 feet and thus be able to glide for a total horizontal distance of 700 feet.

While gliding, the priest moves at a rate of 15 (or about 450 feet) with a maneuverability class of D. Each round, he drops between 20 and 40 feet. He can choose to descend at a much more rapid pace, dropping up to 200 feet per round without risk of a damaging impact upon landing.

In this case, the creature gains or loses 10 feet of movement for every 10 miles per hour of wind velocity. The creature can, at the DM's option, be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control of movement or suffering physical damage.
The spell can be placed upon a trained mount, so it can be ridden through the air. Of course, a mount not accustomed to such movement would certainly need careful and lengthy training, the details for which are up to the DM.
The material components for the spell are the priest's holy symbol and a bit of thistledown."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell clears away weeds, stones, and other debris in a 10-foot-wide path extending 10 feet in front of the caster. The caster can create a continuous path for the duration of the spell, clearing a 10-foot-square ahead of him as long as he continues to move forward. The spell affects jungles, forests, rocky ground, and snow.
The result of the cleared path is that movement costs are reduced by half. This is reflected in a reduction of the penalty against movement in rough terrain. (See Table 74 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for terrain costs for movement.) For example, if clear path is used in heavy jungle, the movement cost is reduced from 8 to 4. In no case can clear path reduce movement cost below 1.
Clear path has no effect on rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water, nor does it affect quicksand, lava, or similar natural obstacles. It also has no effect on magically-created terrain or manmade barricades.
A priest using the clear path spell can be tracked easily. Tracking proficiency is not required.
The material components are a knife blade and a straw from a broom.
The reverse, clutter path, causes weeds, small stones, and similar debris to litter a 10- foot path extending 10 feet behind the caster. This hides a trail, making tracking more difficult. The caster can create a continuous path for the duration of the spell. The chance to successfully track on a cluttered path is reduced by 50%.
The material components are a handful of pebbles and a handful of weeds."}</textarea>

"description":"By means of a control winds spell, the caster is able to alter wind force in the area of effect. For every three levels of experience, the caster can increase or decrease wind force by one level of strength. Wind strengths are as follows: Wind Force Miles Per Hour Light Breeze 2-7 Moderate Breeze 8-18 Strong Breeze 19-31 Gale 32-54 Storm 55-72 Hurricane 73-176 Winds in excess of 19 miles per hour drive small flying creatures--those eagle-sized and under--from the skies, severely affect missile accuracy, and make sailing difficult.
Winds in excess of 32 miles per hour drive even man-sized flying creatures from the skies and cause minor ship damage. Winds in excess of 55 miles per hour drive all flying creatures from the skies, uproot small trees, knock down wooden structures, tear off roofs, and endanger ships. Winds in excess of 73 miles per hour are of hurricane force.
An \"eye\" of 40-foot radius, in which the wind is calm, exists around the caster. Note that while the spell can be used underground, if the spell is cast in an area smaller than the area of effect, the eye shrinks 1 foot for every foot of confinement. For example, if the area of effect is a 360-foot area, the eye shrinks by 10 feet to a 30-foot radius; a space under 320 feet in a radius would eliminate the eye and subject the spellcaster to the effects of the wind. Once the spell is cast, the wind force increases or decreases by 3 miles per hour per round until the maximum or minimum speed is attained. The caster, with one round of complete concentration, can stabilize the wind at its current strength, or set it to increase or decrease. However, the rate of the change cannot be altered. The spell remains in force for one turn for each level of experience of the caster. When the spell is exhausted, the force of the wind wanes or waxes at the same rate, until it reaches the level it was at before the spell took effect. Another caster can use a control winds spell to counter the effects of a like spell up to the limits of his own ability."}</textarea>

"description":"This cooperative spell requires only one priest to cast it, but can be cast only on another priest of the same faith. The recipient of the spell must voluntarily surrender himself to the spell. The recipient becomes a host for the caster. While the recipient does not lose his own persona or ability to act, the host can be dominated by the caster at any time. For the most part, this domination is complete.
For the duration of the spell, the caster is essentially detached from his own body. He can neither move nor act on his own. His mind is connected to the host's. He sees, hears, smells, tastes, and otherwise senses everything the host does. He can telepathically communicate with the host. Once the spell is completed, there is no limit to the range over which it can function. However, both the caster and host must remain on the same plane. Since the spell relies on telepathic communication, thin lead sheeting will effectively block the connection.
When desired, the caster can dominate the host. When this happens, the host's own mind is pushed to the background and the caster's personality dominates. The host's personality, memories, proficiencies, and spells are temporarily replaced by those of the caster. While occupying the host, the caster can cast any spell he himself has memorized, provided that the necessary components are on hand. These spells function exactly as if the priest had cast them from his own body.
The caster can return control to the host at any time, restoring the character's abilities and personality without harm.
The spell is not without limitations and risks. The domination must be voluntary. If the host resists the casting of the spell, it automatically fails. Once the spell is in effect, the host can attempt to resist the domination. He is then allowed a saving throw. If successful, the spell immediately ends.
Whenever the host suffers damage, the caster must make a saving throw vs. death to maintain the spell. If the save is failed, a wave of pain is transmitted to the priest, causing 1d6 points of damage and canceling the spell. If the host should die, the caster must make a system shock roll with the risk of suffering instant death.
The material component is a chalice worth no less than 1,000 gp. This chalice must be given as a gift to the host (who cannot return it to the donor for any reason)."}</textarea>

"description":"This nasty spell \"disconnects\" the subject's short-term and long-term memory. While the spell is in effect, the subject is incapable of storing information in long-term memory.
Every moment is virtually an independent event for the subject; he or she can remember recent events, thoughts, and sensations for no more than a few seconds (the amount of time they remain in short-term memory).
Memories of events that happened before the onset of the spell are not affected at all; these are safely stored in long-term memory. This means that the subject can cast any spells memorized before the memory wrack took effect, but he is likely to have difficulty casting the spell as described below.
The subject of this spell has a limited ability to act. He is restricted to one action at a time and must concentrate mightily to keep the situation and any planned actions in shortterm memory. As long as the subject is able to maintain concentration, he may act normally within these limits.
If the subject is distracted (he is struck in combat, affected by a spell, startled, surprised, or a similar event occurs), he forgets everything that occurred from the onset of the spell to the moment of distraction. The subject must re-evaluate the situation as if it had just come to pass.
Consider the following example. The subject of the spell is a soldier assigned to guard the entrance to a building. The priest arrives and casts memory wrack on the guard.
The guard has no problem remembering his orders, since he received them before the onset of the spell. He also remembers the arrival of the priest. The priest now tries to convince the guard that he is authorized to enter the building. The guard refuses him entry. The priest now picks up a rock and throws it at the guard, striking him and distracting him. The guard forgets everything that happened between the onset of the spell and the moment the rock struck. He forgets that the priest has already tried to con him and that he threw a rock at him. He must reevaluate the situation as though the priest had just arrived. The priest is free to make another attempt at entering the building.
When the spell expires, the subject remembers nothing that happened while the spell was in effect, possibly leading to amusing consequences (\"By the gods, how did I get here?\").
The material component is a ruby of at least 200 gp value, which is crushed during the casting."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell allows the priest to create one specific form of insanity in the subject. Five forms of insanity are possible through this spell.
Schizophrenia: This form of insanity is characterized by personality loss. The subject has no personality of his own, so he selects a role model and makes every possible attempt to behave like that character. The chosen role model will be as different from the subject as possible. (Thus, an insane wizard might begin to follow the habits of a warrior.) Obviously, a warrior who believes himself to be a wizard will be unable to cast spells (he might think that he's casting spells, or he might construct a sophisticated series of excuses explaining why he's \"not in the mood for magic\" at the moment). A character who emulates a member of another class does not gain any of the skills of that class and makes all attacks and saving throws as appropriate to his true class. Certain consequences might arise if the character's emulation causes him to break restrictions of his class. For example, a priest emulating a warrior might break his deity's prohibition against edged weapons, or a paladin might emulate a Neutral Evil thief. Both will suffer the appropriate consequences as if they had been compelled to violate their beliefs while charmed. Such characters will certainly have to atone for their actions once they return to normal.
Dementia praecox: The subject is totally uninterested in any undertaking. Nothing seems worthwhile, and the individual is lethargic and filled with tremendous feelings of boredom and dissatisfaction. No matter how important the situation, it is 50% likely that the subject will ignore it as meaningless.
Delusional insanity: The subject is convinced that he is a famous figure: a monarch, demi-god, or similar personage. Characters who fail to recognize the subject with the honor he deserves incur great hostility or disbelief. The subject acts appropriately to a station that he does not hold. He directs orders at real and imaginary creatures and draws upon resources that do not exist.
Paranoia: The subject is convinced that \"they\" (whoever they are) are spying on him and plotting against him. Everyone around the subject, even friends and allies, is part of the plot. If any other character acts in a way that the subject can interpret as reinforcing this delusion, the subject has a 20% chance of reacting with violence.
Hallucinatory insanity: The subject sees, hears, and otherwise senses things that do not exist. The more stressful the situation is to the subject, the more likely he will hallucinate. Although most hallucinations are external to the subject (that is, he perceives creatures, objects, and conditions that do not exist), there is a 10% chance that any hallucination will involve the subject's self-perception. For example, the subject might suddenly believe and act as if he had sprouted wings, grown to giant size, etc.
When this spell is cast by a priest of 13th level or lower, the DM chooses or randomly selects one of these forms of insanity (and should feel free to invent other interesting symptoms). If the priest is 14th level or higher, he can personally select the form of insanity to afflict the subject.
While under the effect of this spell, the subject can cast spells and use innate powers; the use of these abilities will be in accordance with the symptoms of the insanity, however. Player characters affected by this spell should be encouraged to role-play the appropriate effects to the limit.
The duration of this spell depends on the sum of the subject's Intelligence and Wisdom scores. A saving throw is allowed on a periodic basis depending on this total.
The spell is broken if a successful saving throw is rolled. Refer to the table that follows.
Int+Wis Time Between Checks 8 or less 1 month 9 to 18 3 weeks 19 to 24 2 weeks 25 to 30 1 week 31 to 35 3 days 36 or more 1 day The effects of this spell can be removed by a limited wish, wish (or equally powerful magic), or by a heal spell cast for this specific purpose.
The material component is a small bust of a human head, about 3\" in height, made from fine, delicate china. The priest shatters this bust during the casting."}</textarea>

"description":"By means of this spell, the caster is able to cause a beam of soft, pale light to strike down from overhead and illuminate whatever area he is pointing at. The light is exactly the same as moonlight, so that colors other than shades of black, gray, or white are vague.
The spellcaster can easily make the moonbeam move to any area that he can see and point to. This makes the spell an effective way to spotlight something, an opponent, for example. While the moonbeam spell does not eliminate all shadows, a creature centered in a moonbeam is most certainly visible. The reflected light from this spell enables dim visual perception 10 yards beyond the area of effect, but it does not shed a telltale glow that would negate surprise. The light does not adversely affect infravision. The caster can dim the beam to near darkness if desired. The beam has, in addition, all the properties of true moonlight and can induce a lycanthropic change (of a creature in the beam), unless the DM rules otherwise.
The material components are several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar (moonstone)."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">By means of this spell, the caster is able to cause a beam of soft, pale light to strike down from overhead and illuminate whatever area he is pointing at. The light is exactly the same as moonlight, so that colors other than shades of black, gray, or white are vague.<br />The spellcaster can easily make the moonbeam move to any area that he can see and point to. This makes the spell an effective way to spotlight something, an opponent, for example. While the moonbeam spell does not eliminate all shadows, a creature centered in a moonbeam is most certainly visible. The reflected light from this spell enables dim visual perception 10 yards beyond the area of effect, but it does not shed a telltale glow that would negate surprise. The light does not adversely affect infravision. The caster can dim the beam to near darkness if desired. The beam has, in addition, all the properties of true moonlight and can induce a lycanthropic change (of a creature in the beam), unless the DM rules otherwise.<br />The material components are several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar (moonstone).</div>

"description":"When a priest enters othertime, he steps into a different reality in which the world around him is frozen at a moment in the future. Until time catches up to him, he may move about unhindered and observe his surroundings; no force known can detect his presence or harm him in the alternate reality, although he in turn cannot affect any creature or object in the physical world. For instance, he could read a book at the page it was opened to, but he could not turn the page since that would require him to move an object that is temporarily immovable for him. To his companions or enemy in real time, the priest appears to simply vanish altogether, only to reappear at some later point.
The duration of this spell is a little odd, to say the least. The priest may choose a duration of up to 1 round at 7th to 9th level, 2 rounds at 10th to 12th level, 3 rounds at 13th to 16th, 4 rounds at 17th to 19th, up to a maximum of 5 rounds at 20th level or higher. The duration chosen by the priest governs the length of the othertime; if the priest decides that the spell will last 2 rounds, then he is instantly transported to that point in time, surrounded by the frozen still-life of the world as it will appear 2 rounds after the priest cast othertime. The caster then has 2 rounds to himself to take any actions he cares to, although he cannot affect the real world by any physical, magical, or mental means.
While the caster is in the othertime, he is completely unaware of the intervening events. In the example above, if the caster's friends were teleported away 1 round after the caster left and replaced by an identical group of dopplegangers, the caster would have no chance to detect the switch; all he sees are the bodies of his \"friends,\" frozen in the positions they will occupy when he emerges from the othertime. This also means that nasty things like dragon breath, cloudkills, or mind blasts that pass through the spot where the caster happens to be have no effect on him-he simply does not exist in the real world while he waits for everyone else to catch up to him.
As noted above, the caster gains an amount of subjective time equal to the duration of the spell. By leaping 3 rounds into the future, the caster gains 3 rounds of actions in the othertime. He could drink a potion, cast a spell, and then maneuver for an attack, for example, or he could gain a 3-round head start by running for his life while no one else can pursue him. If the priest uses this time to study a battle and position himself for an attack, he gains a -4 bonus to his initiative roll on the round he emerges from othertime, and a +4 attack bonus with his first strike.
Leaping in and out of the time stream is a dangerous activity; every time the priest employs this spell, there is a 1% noncumulative chance that he becomes stuck in othertime, doomed to death by thirst or starvation when his own rations run out. Only the most extraordinary measures (a wish spell, divine intervention, etc.) can save a character in this predicament. Once a priest is in othertime, he cannot pray for further spells. After all, if the priest is going to attract his deity's attention by praying for spells, the deity will most likely allow him out! The material component for this spell is an hourglass filled with rare salts, worth at least 100 gold pieces."}</textarea>

If there is no source of water or even enough humidity to support this spell, then the DM can rule that the spell has no effect.

This can have several effects; first of all, any creature caught in the area of effect when the temperature is lowered suffers 2d4 damage plus 1 point per level of the caster (or 2d4+12, for the 12th-level caster described above), or half that damage with a successful saving throw vs. spell. Any fires in the area are suppressed and may (50% chance) be extinguished.
Creatures entering the area of effect after the initial creation of ice suffer no additional damage, although the air will be noticeably dry and cold. However, the ice formed by the spell coats all surfaces and may cause creatures to slip and fall. Any creature moving into or out of the affected area must make a saving throw vs. spell or fall, losing their action for the round. The ice lasts at least 2 rounds per caster level, and then begins to melt at whatever rate nature decrees.
If cast on a body of water, this spell creates an iceberg of the stated dimensions. A swimmer or aquatic creature could be caught in the ice and trapped until the ice melts; most air-breathers will suffocate from this treatment, but a few aquatic creatures (fish, amphibians, etc.) may survive being frozen, at the DM's discretion.

"description":"To cast this spell, the priest must be in sight of a rainbow, or have a special component (see below). The rainbow spell has two applications, and the priest can choose the desired one at the time of casting. These applications are as follows: Bow: The spell creates a shimmering, multi-layered short composite bow of rainbow hues. It is light and easy to pull, so that any character can use it without penalty for nonproficiency.
It is magical: Each of its shimmering missiles is the equivalent of a +2 weapon, including attack and damage bonuses. Magic resistance can negate the effect of any missile fired from the bow. The bow fires seven missiles before disappearing. It can be fired up to four times per round. Each time a missile is fired, one hue leaves the bow, corresponding to the color of arrow that is released. Each color of arrow has the ability to cause double damage to certain creatures, as follows: Red --fire dwellers/users and fire elementals Orange --creatures or constructs of clay, sand, earth, stone or similar materials, and earth elementals Yellow --vegetable opponents (including fungus creatures, shambling mounds, treants, etc.) Green --aquatic creatures, electricity-using creatures, and air elementals Indigo --acid-using or poison-using creatures Violet --metallic or regenerating creatures When the bow is drawn, an arrow of the appropriate color magically appears, nocked and ready. If no color is requested, or a color that has already been used is asked for, then the next arrow (in the order of the spectrum) appears.
Bridge: The caster causes the rainbow to form a seven-hued bridge up to 3 feet wide per level of the caster. It must be at least 20 feet long and can be as long as 120 yards, according to the caster's desire. It lasts as long as the spell's duration or until ordered out of existence by the caster.
The components for this spell are the priest's holy symbol and a vial of holy water. If no rainbow is in the vicinity, the caster can substitute a diamond of not less than 1,000 gp value, specially prepared with bless and prayer spells while in sight of a rainbow. The holy water and diamond disappear when the spell is cast."}</textarea>

It must be at least 20 feet long and can be as long as 120 yards, according to the caster&#039;s desire. It lasts as long as the spell&#039;s duration or until ordered out of existence by the caster.<br />The components for this spell are the priest&#039;s holy symbol and a vial of holy water. If no rainbow is in the vicinity, the caster can substitute a diamond of not less than 1,000 gp value, specially prepared with bless and prayer spells while in sight of a rainbow. The holy water and diamond disappear when the spell is cast.</div>

"description":"When the priest casts a raise dead spell, he can restore life to a dwarf, gnome, half-elf, halfling, or human (other creatures may be allowed, at the DM's option). The length of time that the person has been dead is of importance, as the priest can raise persons dead only up to a limit of one day for each experience level of the priest (i.e., a 9th-level priest can raise a person who has been dead for up to nine days).
Note that the body of the person must be whole, or otherwise missing parts are still missing when the person is brought back to life. Likewise, other ills, such as poison and disease, are not negated. The raised person must roll a successful resurrection survival check to survive the ordeal (see Table 3: Constitution) and loses 1 point of Constitution.
Further, the raised person is weak and helpless, needing a minimum of one full day of rest in bed for each day or fraction he was dead. The person has 1 hit point when raised and must regain the rest by natural healing or curative magic.
A character's starting Constitution is an absolute limit to the number of times he can be revived by this means.
The somatic component of the spell is a pointed finger.
The reverse of the spell, slay living, grants the victim a saving throw vs. death magic.
If the saving throw is successful, the victim sustains damage equal to that of a cause serious wounds spell--i.e., 2d8+1 points. Failure means the victim dies instantly."}</textarea>

"description":"This cooperative spell can be cast by either a single priest or a group of priests.
Thoughtwave allows the priest to send a short but powerful message to one or more specific individuals, informing them of his situation and general location. The spell instantly generates a powerful mental impulse indicative of the caster's general mental state--anger, fear, pain, despair, etc.
The caster can designate as many as ten persons to receive this message, provided they can all be specifically named or grouped in a general category. Thus, the caster could designate a group of characters by name or could target \"fellow priests,\" \"superiors,\" \"adventuring companions,\" \"knights of Lord Harcourt,\" or \"villagers of Dopp.\" If more than ten individuals are in the group, those closest to the source will receive the impulse.
There is no range limitation to the spell, although it cannot be projected outside the plane occupied by the caster.
Creatures receiving the impulse automatically know who sent it (even if they have never met the priest before) and gain a clear indication of the mood and situation of the caster. Recipients also intuitively know the general source of the spell, although they are unable to pinpoint rooms, dungeon levels, or landmarks. For example, a fighter could suddenly be struck by an image of Father Rastibon, who is injured and in great pain somewhere along the forest road. A priest might suddenly sense that his patriarch is being tortured in the dungeons of Castle Varrack.
The spell can also be cast by more than one priest, allowing them to either contact greater numbers of individuals or increase the intensity of the message. If greater numbers are desired, ten characters are contacted per priest involved in the casting.
Increasing the intensity of the message makes it more compelling. Doubling the intensity (requiring at least three priests) causes the message to act as a suggestion. In this case, the effect is limited to a single target. Tripling the intensity (requiring at least five priests) gives the spell the force of a quest. This effect is also limited to a single target. In both cases, the target is allowed a saving throw to avoid the effect of the suggestion or quest."}</textarea>

Secret doors become plain. The exact location of displaced things is obvious. Invisible things become quite visible. Illusions and apparitions are seen through. Polymorphed, changed, or enchanted things are apparent. Even the aura projected by creatures becomes visible, so that alignment can be discerned. Further, the recipient can focus his vision to see into the Ethereal plane or the bordering areas of adjacent planes. The range of vision conferred is 120 feet. True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects; it in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic.
The spell requires an ointment for the eyes that is made from very rare mushroom powder, saffron, and fat and costs no less than 300 gp per use.
The reverse, false seeing, causes the person to see things as they are not: rich is poor, rough is smooth, beautiful is ugly. The ointment for the reverse spell is concocted of oil, poppy dust, and pink orchid essence.
For both spells, the ointment must be aged for 1d6 months."}</textarea>

The wall of fire must be cast so that it is vertical with respect to the caster.

"description":"This spell ages the targeted creature one year per level of the caster. Unwilling subjects may attempt a saving throw to resist the spell. Subjects affected by age creature must make a successful system shock roll to survive the change.
Subjects cannot be aged beyond their natural life spans. If the priest's level indicates that a creature would be aged beyond this level, the creature is aged to one year short of his maximum age. The spell cannot cause a subject to die.
Human and humanoid characters affected by the spell experience changes in appearance associated with increased age, such as gray hair and wrinkles. More significantly, they suffer losses in Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution when they reach certain age levels. These are summarized in Table 12: Aging Effects in the Player's Handbook. The Player's Handbook also provides rules for determining a character's base age.
Nonmagical monsters can be affected by age creature. The DM determines a monster's current age and natural life span based on its description in the MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM or based on his own judgment. To determine the effects of aging on a monster, assume the following: a monster is middle-aged when it reaches half its natural life span; a monster reaches old age at two-thirds of its natural life span; a monster reaches venerable age in the last one-sixth of its years. A monster suffers the penalties which follow when it reaches these age levels. The penalties are cumulative and permanent (unless the affected monster becomes younger).
Age Penalty Middle Age -1 to all saving throws Old Age -1 to all saving throws -1 to all attack rolls Venerable -1 to all saving throws -1 to all attack rolls The material component is a pinch of powdered emerald.
The reverse of this spell, restore youth, permanently restores age that has been lost as a result of magic (such as an age creature spell). Restore youth reduces the age of the targeted creature by one year per level of the caster. The subject must make a successful system shock roll to survive the change. Subjects who become younger regain the lost ability scores described above. A subject cannot become younger than his actual age as a result of this spell.

"description":"This spell allows the caster to temporarily convince himself that certain objects or as many as four creatures within the area of effect do not actually exist. While disbelief remains in effect, these objects or creatures cannot harm or hinder the caster. He can pass through them as if they did not exist and takes no damage from their attacks or actions.
However, since these objects or creatures temporarily do not exist for the priest, he can take no action against them. If the creatures attack, the caster receives no Dexterity bonus to armor class (since this bonus represents dodging, and the priest is unable to dodge a creature that does not exist for him).
The caster can attempt to disbelieve as many as four creatures within 60 feet of his position at the time of casting. He disbelieves the same four creatures for the duration of the spell. Alternatively, the priest can disbelieve any or all inanimate objects of up to 20- cubic-yard volume (thus, he may disbelieve a 12 foot by 15 foot area of 3-foot-thick wall). This volume must be centered on a point no more than 20 yards from the caster.
These two options are mutually exclusive; the priest can disbelieve only creatures or objects, not a combination of both.
Disbelieving a creature includes all gear, equipment, or treasure carried or worn by that creature; it does not include other objects that come into contact with that creature, such as walls, doors, chairs, etc.
Disbelief is not automatic; it requires an extreme effort. To successfully disbelieve, the priest must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation. A successful save means the priest has disbelieved; an unsuccessful check means that the spell has failed and the priest has not convinced himself of the creatures' or objects' non-existence.
While this spell is in effect, the DM must record any damage suffered by the priest from disbelieved creatures. When the spell ends, the caster makes a saving throw vs.
spell. If the saving throw is successful, the priest suffers only one-eighth of any damage inflicted by the creatures (round all fractions down); if the priest fails the saving throw, he suffers one-half of any damage inflicted (round fractions down)."}</textarea>

"description":"The fire seeds spell creates special missiles or timed incendiaries that burn with great heat. The spell can be cast to create either fire seed missiles or fire seed incendiaries, as chosen when the spell is cast.
Fire seed missiles: This casting turns up to four acorns into special grenadelike missiles that can be hurled up to 40 yards. An attack roll is required to strike the intended target, and proficiency penalties are considered. Each acorn bursts upon striking any hard surface, causing 2d8 points of damage and igniting any combustible materials within a 10-foot diameter of the point of impact. If a successful saving throw vs. spell is made, a creature within the burst area receives only one-half damage, but a creature struck directly suffers full damage (i.e., no saving throw).
Fire seed incendiaries: This casting turns up to eight holly berries into special incendiaries. The holly berries are most often placed, being too light to make effective missiles. They can be tossed only up to 6 feet away. They burst into flame if the caster is within 40 yards and speaks a word of command. The berries instantly ignite, causing 1d8 points of damage to any creature and igniting any combustible within a 5-foot-diameter burst area. Creatures within the area that successfully save vs. spell suffer half damage.
All fire seeds lose their power after a duration equal to one turn per experience level of the caster--e.g., the seeds of a 13th-level caster remain potent for a maximum of 13 turns after their creation.

Each participant sees, hears, and otherwise senses everything experienced by the other, although such \"vicarious\" experiences feel weak and cannot be mistaken for direct sensations. Participants can shut off these experiences at will if they find them confusing or distracting.
The participants can share such personal concepts as plans, hopes, and fears, although they cannot communicate complex or detailed information. It is impossible to communicate the procedure for casting a spell or picking a lock.
Communication through group mind is approximately 30 times faster than verbal communication. The priest can maintain only one group mind spell at any time; thus, he cannot communicate with multiple groups.

"description":"This spell is similar to the 9th-level wizard spell time stop. When reverse time is cast, time stops within a 30-foot diameter of the subject. All creatures and items in the area of effect stand motionless, rivers stop running, and arrows hang suspended in the air. Any creature, person, or object entering the area of effect is likewise frozen in time. The caster is affected if he is within the area of effect, unless he is the subject of the spell.
An unwilling subject is allowed a saving throw vs. spell; if successful, the spell is immediately negated. Otherwise, the victim is forced to relive all the actions taken in the previous 1-4 rounds in reverse. Beginning with the most recent round, the subject moves backward, arrows fired by the subject return to his bow, and so on. All effects of these actions are negated. At the end of the spell's duration, normal time resumes and all creatures immediately continue their activities, picking up right where they had stopped.
Consider the following example. A party is battling a spellcasting red dragon. In the first round, the dragon breathes fire, roasting the party's wizard. The rest of the group attacks and injures the dragon. On the second round, the dragon bites and kills the group's thief. More damage is caused to the beast, but it is still alive in the third round, when it uses magic missile to kill the ranger. At this point, the priest casts reverse time on the beast. Fortunately, it fails its saving throw and is forced to reverse the last four rounds.
While everyone else freezes, the dragon goes into reverse. The magic missiles zoom back to the dragon (and it regains the ability to cast that spell), it \"unbites\" the thief (removing that damage from the character), and then inhales its fiery breath (leaving the roasted wizard alive and uncooked). The dragon is then reversed through one more round--the round before it encounterd the party. The spell then ends and actions resume.
The dragon must now roll for surprise since it is encountering the party for the first time. The party is immune to surprise, since it was fighting the beast previously. All damage suffered by the dragon remains, since these actions were caused by the group and not the beast.
The material component is an etched silver arrow bent into a circle. The arrow must be no more than 3 inches long and worth no less than 500 gp. The arrow is destroyed in the casting."}</textarea>

That is, the monster understands, in its own language or equivalent, the intent of what is said to it by the priest and vice versa. The creature thus spoken to is checked by the DM to determine a reaction. All creatures of the same type as that chosen by the priest can likewise understand if they are within range. The priest can speak to different types of creatures during the spell duration, but he must speak separately to each type. The spell lasts for two rounds per caster level.</div>

Any creature of size L (large) or smaller that comes in contact with the whirlwind must make a saving throw vs. breath weapon or suffer 2d8 damage.

The caster may direct the cyclone to eject any carried creatures whenever he wishes, depositing the hapless souls wherever the whirlwind happens to be when they are released.
Maintaining the whirlwind requires the caster's full attention, and he cannot cast other spells or make any attacks while directing the spell's course.

				<div class="description-content">When a priest casts this spell, he creates an invisible force field or barrier that blocks the entrance of animated or living mineral creatures. It is effective against elementals and creatures of elemental origin such as aerial servants, djinns, and mephits; golems and other constructs; creatures of living stone, such as galeb duhr or xorn; and objects, weapons, or armor animated by some outside force. It does not bar the passage of undead monsters, living creatures carrying inanimate material, or nonanimated minerals such as a giant-thrown boulder or a common rockslide. The antimineral shell moves with the caster, but if the caster tries to force it against a creature affected by this spell, the antimineral shell fails. The material component is a drop of some caustic solvent, such as acid from a black dragon.</div>

"description":"By means of this spell, a priest is able to project his astral body into the Astral plane, leaving his physical body and material possessions behind on the Prime Material plane.
As the Astral plane touches upon the first levels of all the outer planes, the priest can travel astrally to the first level of any of these outer planes as he wills. The priest then leaves the Astral plane, forming a body on the plane of existence he has chosen to enter.
It is also possible to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime Material plane by means of the astral spell. However, a second body cannot be formed on the Prime Material plane.
As a general rule, a person astrally projected can be seen only by creatures on the Astral plane. The astral body is connected at all times to the material body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the affected person is killed, astrally and materially, but generally only the psychic wind can cause the cord to break. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body.
If the second body or astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to the caster's body where the body rests on the Prime Material plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.
The spell lasts until the priest desires to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic spell or destruction of the priest's body on the Prime Material plane--which kills the priest. The priest can project the astral forms of up to seven other creatures with himself by means of the astral spell, providing the creatures are linked in a circle with the priest. These fellow travelers are dependent upon the priest and can be stranded if something happens to the priest. Travel in the Astral plane can be slow or fast, according to the priest's desire. The ultimate destination arrived at is subject to the desire of the priest."}</textarea>

"description":"This powerful spell enables the caster to cure many persons (even an entire community) who are afflicted with a nonmagical disease. The priest need not touch or even see the diseased people for the spell to be effective, although recipients must be within the area of effect.
This spell does not cure all diseases in the community at one time; the caster must specifically state which disease is to be eliminated (black plague or yellow fever, for example) with each casting of the spell.
When the spell is cast, the priest exhales a sweet-smelling breath. This forms into a breeze that radiates outward, forming a circle that expands in a 50-yard radius per hour.
During this time, the caster must remain at the center of the area of effect. For example, after 12 hours, the breath of life would cover a circle 1200 yards in diameter (600-yard radius). The breath is of a magical nature rather than a physical nature; therefore, it is unaffected by prevailing winds.
The breeze blows through the community, instantly eliminating the specified disease from all afflicted citizens. The breath of life spell does not destroy parasitic monsters (such as green slime, rot grubs, and others), nor does it cure lycanthropy or other magical afflictions. The spell does not prevent recurrence of a disease if the recipients are again exposed.
The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a cone of incense that has been blessed by the highest priest of the character's religion.
The breath of death, which produces a foul-smelling wind, is the reverse of this spell.
Victims who fail a saving throw vs. death magic are afflicted with a nonmagical, fatal disease. To determine the results of this spell, the DM should roll saving throws for major NPCs in the area of effect. The effect on the rest of the community can be calculated as a percentage, based on the saving throw.
Infected creatures do not heal hit points until the disease is cured. The disease is fatal within 1d6 weeks (the duration varies from person to person).
The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a handful of dust taken from a mummy's corpse."}</textarea>

"description":"When this spell is cast, it brings forth a large, flaming chariot pulled by two fiery horses from the elemental plane of Fire. These appear in a clap of thunder amid a cloud of smoke. The vehicle moves at 24 on the ground, 48 flying, and can carry the caster and up to seven other creatures of man-size or less. The passengers must be touched by the caster to protect them from the flames of the chariot. Creatures other than the caster and his designated passengers sustain 2d4 points of fire damage each round if they come within 5 feet of the horses or chariot. Such creatures suffer no damage if they evade the area by rolling successful saving throws vs. petrification, with Dexterity adjustments.
The caster controls the chariot by verbal command, causing the flaming steeds to stop or go, walk, trot, run or fly, and turn left or right as he desires. Note that the chariot of Sustarre is a physical manifestation and can sustain damage. The vehicle and steeds are struck only by magical weapons or by water (one quart of which inflicts 1 point of damage). They are Armor Class 2, and each requires 30 points of damage to dispel.
Naturally, fire has no effect upon either the vehicle or its steeds, but magical fires other than those of the chariot can affect the riders. Other spells, such as a successful dispel magic or holy word, will force the chariot back to its home plane, without its passengers.
The chariot can be summoned only once per week.
The material components are a small piece of wood, two holly berries, and a fire source at least equal to a torch."}</textarea>

Weather conditions have three components: precipitation, temperature, and wind.

The lower-case headings below are the new conditions to which the caster can change the existing conditions. In addition, the caster can control the direction of the wind. For example, a day that is clear, warm, and with moderate wind can be controlled to become hazy, hot, and calm. Contradictions are not possible--fog and strong wind, for example. Multiple control weather spells can be used only in succession.
The material components for this spell are the priest's religious symbol, incense, and prayer beads or similar prayer object. Obviously, the spell functions only in areas where there are appropriate climatic conditions.
If Weather is a major sphere for the priest (as it is for druids), duration and area are doubled, and the caster can change the prevailing weather by two places. For example, he can cause precipitation to go from partly cloudy to heavy sleet, temperature to go from cool to arctic, and wind to go from calm to strong."}</textarea>

For example, he can cause precipitation to go from partly cloudy to heavy sleet, temperature to go from cool to arctic, and wind to go from calm to strong.</div>

The shock is over in one round. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in its area of effect.

Solidly built structures with foundations reaching down to bedrock sustain one-half damage; one-quarter damage if they score above 50% on a saving throw.

The road is approximately one foot thick and hovers in the air. It has the texture and color of black granite. Characters and creatures can move on the hovering road at their normal movement rate, ignoring the effects of surrounding terrain.
The hovering road must originate from a solid surface. Once anchored, the caster controls the contour of the road, causing it to rise and fall as he wishes. The road can thus be used to traverse rivers (if the road is anchored on the shore), swamps, and similarly hostile terrain. The caster can cause the hovering road to rise over a jungle or cross a chasm.
The road has AC 0. It is impervious to non-magical weapons. If the road suffers 100 points of damage (from magical weapons or other magical forces), it dissipates in a black mist; all those on the road fall to the ground below.
Unless the road is destroyed, the entire hovering road remains intact from beginning to end for the duration of the spell, even if the caster is killed or incapacitated. At the end of the spell's duration, the entire road dissipates.
The material components are a chunk of black marble and a loop of gold wire."}</textarea>

"description":"The priest is able to restore life and complete strength to any living creature, including elves, by bestowing the resurrection spell. The creature can have been dead up to 10 years per level of the priest casting the spell. Thus, a 19th-level priest can resurrect the bones of a creature dead up to 190 years. The creature, upon surviving a resurrection survival check, is immediately restored to full hit points and can perform strenuous activity. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has reached its allotted life span (i.e., died of natural causes). Casting this spell makes it impossible for the priest to cast further spells or engage in combat until he has had one day of bed rest for each experience level or Hit Die of the creature brought back to life. The caster ages three years upon casting this spell.
The reverse, destruction, causes the victim of the spell to be instantly dead and turned to dust. A wish spell or equivalent is required for recovery. Destruction requires a touch, either in combat or otherwise, and does not age the caster. In addition, the victim is allowed a saving throw (with a -4 penalty). If the save is successful, the victim receives 8d6 points of damage instead.
The material components of the spell are the priest's religious symbol and holy water (unholy water for the reverse spell). The DM may reduce the chances of successful resurrection if little of the creature's remains are available."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">The priest is able to restore life and complete strength to any living creature, including elves, by bestowing the resurrection spell. The creature can have been dead up to 10 years per level of the priest casting the spell. Thus, a 19th-level priest can resurrect the bones of a creature dead up to 190 years. The creature, upon surviving a resurrection survival check, is immediately restored to full hit points and can perform strenuous activity. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has reached its allotted life span (i.e., died of natural causes). Casting this spell makes it impossible for the priest to cast further spells or engage in combat until he has had one day of bed rest for each experience level or Hit Die of the creature brought back to life. The caster ages three years upon casting this spell.<br />The reverse, destruction, causes the victim of the spell to be instantly dead and turned to dust. A wish spell or equivalent is required for recovery. Destruction requires a touch, either in combat or otherwise, and does not age the caster. In addition, the victim is allowed a saving throw (with a -4 penalty). If the save is successful, the victim receives 8d6 points of damage instead.<br />The material components of the spell are the priest&#039;s religious symbol and holy water (unholy water for the reverse spell). The DM may reduce the chances of successful resurrection if little of the creature&#039;s remains are available.</div>

"description":"This mighty spell summons a tsunami, or gigantic wave, from any major body of water. The body of water must be at least 1 mile in width, so in most circumstances the tsunami can only be summoned from the sea, large lakes, or extremely big rivers. The wave is 2 feet high and 10 feet long for each level of experience of the caster, so a 15th-level priest would summon a tsunami 30 feet high and 150 feet wide. The wave can appear anywhere within the spell's range and immediately sweeps forward in the direction specified by the caster. This may take it out of the allowed range or even back at the casting priest. The tsunami moves at a rate of 24 (240 yards per round) and lasts one round at 14th level, two rounds at 18th level, or three rounds at 22nd or higher level.
Ships caught by the tsunami must make a seaworthiness check (see Table 77: Tsunami Ship Types in the DMG) with a penalty equal to the wave's height in feet. For example, a tsunami created by a 15th-level caster would inflict a -30% penalty to a vessel's seaworthiness check. If the check is failed, the vessel capsizes and sinks in 1d10 rounds, with the possible loss of those aboard. Human or humanoid swimmers caught in the wave must make a saving throw vs. death magic or be drowned in the wave; any creature in the water in the wave's path will be carried along as long as it lasts.
If the priest sent the wave towards the shore, the tsunami loses 5 feet of height for every 20 yards it travels; a 30-foot wave could wash 120 yards inland before there was nothing left of it. Creatures caught in the area sustain 1d4 points of damage for every 5 feet of height the tsunami currently possesses and are carried along until it ends.
Air-breathing creatures must make saving throws vs. death magic or be drowned outright by this treatment. Wooden buildings have a chance equal to three times the wave's current height of being destroyed by the tsunami (90% for a 30-foot wave, for example) while stone buildings have a chance equal to the wave's height (or 30% for a 30-foot wave). Topography may influence or channel the wave's advance, so a good-sized hill could stop a tsunami cold, although its seaward face may be denuded of creatures and vegetation by the wave.
Note that this spell in the hands of a high-level character can blanket an awesome amount of territory and literally destroy or drown anything in its path. The tsunami is so strenuous a spell that the priest is exhausted and helpless for 1d6 hours after summoning it."}</textarea>
