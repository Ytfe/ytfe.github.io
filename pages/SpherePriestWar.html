"description":"This spell allows a priest to plant a section of ground with magically created caltrops.
The spell can create two kinds of caltrops: infantry and cavalry. The first are of small size and are designed to harm foot soldiers. The latter are larger and cause serious damage to cavalry or units composed of size L or larger creatures. Cavalry caltrops are so large that size M or smaller creatures can easily step around them. This prevents damage to infantry units.
Each time a unit moves into a planted area, the unit suffers an attack of AD4 (for infantry caltrops) or AD6 (for cavalry caltrops). Units charging through a planted area suffer double damage. If a unit ends its movement in a caltrop-sown region, it suffers another attack when it moves out of the area.
This spell can create a rectangular field of infantry caltrops up to 160 square yards in area (e.g., 4 yards x 40 yards, 2 yards x 80 yards, etc.), or a field of cavalry caltrops up to 90 square yards in area (e.g., 3 yards x 30 yards, 2 yards x 45 yards, etc.).
Ordinary caltrops make no distinction between friend or foe; all creatures entering a caltrop-sown area suffer the same consequences. The same is true of magical caltrops, with one exception: the casting priest can terminate the spell at any time, causing the caltrops to vanish and leaving the terrain clear.
Unlike normal caltrops, a region sown with magical caltrops cannot be \"swept\" clear; the magical caltrops remain in place until the spell terminates.
The material component is a golden caltrop."}</textarea>

				<div class="description-content">This spell allows a priest to plant a section of ground with magically created caltrops.<br />The spell can create two kinds of caltrops: infantry and cavalry. The first are of small size and are designed to harm foot soldiers. The latter are larger and cause serious damage to cavalry or units composed of size L or larger creatures. Cavalry caltrops are so large that size M or smaller creatures can easily step around them. This prevents damage to infantry units.<br />Each time a unit moves into a planted area, the unit suffers an attack of AD4 (for infantry caltrops) or AD6 (for cavalry caltrops). Units charging through a planted area suffer double damage. If a unit ends its movement in a caltrop-sown region, it suffers another attack when it moves out of the area.<br />This spell can create a rectangular field of infantry caltrops up to 160 square yards in area (e.g., 4 yards x 40 yards, 2 yards x 80 yards, etc.), or a field of cavalry caltrops up to 90 square yards in area (e.g., 3 yards x 30 yards, 2 yards x 45 yards, etc.).<br />Ordinary caltrops make no distinction between friend or foe; all creatures entering a caltrop-sown area suffer the same consequences. The same is true of magical caltrops, with one exception: the casting priest can terminate the spell at any time, causing the caltrops to vanish and leaving the terrain clear.<br />Unlike normal caltrops, a region sown with magical caltrops cannot be &quot;swept&quot; clear; the magical caltrops remain in place until the spell terminates.<br />The material component is a golden caltrop.</div>

"description":"By means of this spell, the priest prepares an area as a defensive position. Fortify may be used to prepare an open outdoors area such as a field, road, or grassland, or a rough or broken outdoors area such as a hillside, forest, or boulder-fall. Large rooms or chambers such as a cavern or a great hall may be fortified as well. The exact effects of the spell depend on the nature of the site to be fortified.
A. Open Outdoors Site: A rampart or dike of earth and loose stone rises from the ground along the perimeter of the site, leaving a shallow ditch on the outward face.
Creatures defending the dike receive 50% cover against missile fire (+4 bonus to AC), or 25% cover (+2 bonus) if they expose themselves by engaging in melee combat or firing missiles out of the dike. Attackers cannot charge, run, or sprint over the ditch-and-dike.
Large, open rooms or chambers with few features may fall into this category.
B. Rough Outdoors Site: Loose stones and boulders, deadwood, and patches of dense briars are arranged to form a defensible wall or rampart along the perimeter of the area of effect. Characters hiding behind the wall receive 75% cover (+7 bonus to AC), or 50% cover if they expose themselves by firing missiles or defending the wall. In hand-to-hand combat, the wall's defenders receive a +1 bonus to attack rolls; man-sized attackers must spend one full round in climbing over the wall in order to enter the fortified area. Natural caverns and large, cluttered chambers fall into this category, as well.
C. Marshy or Low-lying Site: In areas such as swamp, marsh, bog, or tundra, fortify cannot raise a wall or dike to cover the defenders. Instead, the spell creates a water-filled ditch around the perimeter of the area of effect. This ditch is 10 feet wide and 2 to 4 feet deep; most creatures require 1 full round to negotiate the ditch, and defenders gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against enemies who are wading the ditch or climbing up the other side.
The fortifications are permanent, although erosion, weathering, and excavations, clearing, or filling can quickly raze the site, returning it to its original state. The material component is the shell of a snail dusted with 100 gold pieces worth of diamond powder.
In Battlesystem rules, fortify provides a defending unit with a +2 bonus to its AR against missile and melee attacks, but no bonus against missile attacks in marshy or low-lying areas."}</textarea>

"description":"An improved version of the fortify spell, entrench has much the same effect, but prepares an even more formidable set of defenses. Like fortify, entrench may be used to prepare an open outdoors area such as a field or grassland, or a rough outdoors area such as a hillside or forest. Large rooms or chambers may be entrenched as well. In addition to the ditches and ramparts of the fortify spell, entrench makes use of local materials to create a small palisade and an array of stakes or sharp stones to discourage attackers.
A. Open Outdoors Site: A rampart or dike of earth faced by a staked ditch rises from the ground along the perimeter of the site. Creatures defending the dike receive 75% cover against missile fire (+7 bonus to AC), or 25% cover (+2 bonus) if they expose themselves by engaging in melee combat or firing missiles out of the dike. Attackers cannot charge, run, or sprint over the rampart, and must spend one full round negotiating the defenses in order to attack. The dike's defenders receive a +1 bonus to attack rolls against any creatures trying to move through the stakes or stones.
B. Rough Outdoors Site: Loose stones, deadwood, and briars are arranged to form a defensible wall along the perimeter of the area of effect, faced by an array of sharp stakes or stones. Characters hiding behind the wall receive 90% cover (+10 bonus to AC), or 50% cover (+4 bonus) if they expose themselves by firing missiles or defending the wall. Attacking creatures cannot run, charge, or sprint through the defenses, and must spend one full round to get through the stakes plus an additional round climbing over the wall in order to enter the fortified area. The wall's defenders gain a +1 bonus to attacks against creatures negotiating the defenses.
C. Marshy or Low-lying Site: In swamps or bogs, entrench creates a water-filled ditch around the perimeter of the area of effect. This ditch is 15 feet wide and 3 to 6 feet deep; most creatures require two full rounds to negotiate the ditch and climb up the far side, and defenders gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against enemies who are wading the ditch or climbing up the other side.
The fortifications created by this spell are permanent, although erosion, weathering, and clearing or filling can return the site to its original state. The material component is the shell of a giant nautilus. In the Battlesystem rules, entrench provides the defending units with a +3 bonus to their AR versus missile and melee attacks, but only a +1 bonus against missile attacks in marshy areas."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell can be cast in one of two variations. The first, appropriate for battlefield use, has a range of 240 yards, duration of 1d4+6 turns, and a casting time of 1 turn. The priest can cast the spell on any single individual (a commander or hero) within his line of sight.
While under the influence of this spell, the subject's command radius is increased by 50% (round fractions up).
The reverse of this variation, doubt, requires the target to make a saving throw vs.
spell. If failed, doubt halves the command radius (round fractions down) of the targeted individual for 1d3+4 turns.
The material component for this variation is a pinch of steel dust.
The second variation must take place in or within 100' of a place of worship officially dedicated to the casting priest's deity. Both the priest and the individual to be affected must be present. The casting time is 5 turns and involves an intricate ritual and many prayers. At the conclusion of the spell, the subject's command radius is doubled. This effect lasts 2d12 hours.
The priest can cast either aspect (but not both at once) on himself. No individual can be the subject of more than one casting of this spell at one time, whether different aspects or cast by different priests. If more than one spell is attempted on the individual, only the most recent casting takes effect.
The material component for the second variation is the priest's holy symbol."}</textarea>

Disguise cannot change the size category of the unit's members. Thus, a unit of humans may appear to be a unit of elves, but may not appear as a unit of giants or halflings.

The disguised unit may appear to be carrying any melee or personal missile weapons (e.g., axes, long swords, crossbows, etc.), and may appear to be wearing any type of armor.

Disguise is most effective at long range. If another unit moves within 20 yards of a disguised unit, it automatically sees through the illusion.
The caster automatically sees through the illusion. Members of the subject unit see no change in their appearance. True seeing or similar magic is required for other individuals to see through the disguise (unless they move within 20 yards of the unit).

"description":"This spell creates a vivid illusion of incoming artillery fire (ballista bolts, catapult stones, etc.) at a target indicated by the caster.

It is impossible for victims to determine where the missiles were fired from; creatures under attack notice the missiles only when they are about to strike.

"description":"The ritual required to cast this spell is time-consuming and extremely complex. As its name implies, illusory fortification creates an illusion of a wall of heavy stonework up to 30 feet tall and 160 yards long, topped with crenellations. The illusory wall can be of any color and apparent age, potentially allowing the caster to match the false wall with the real walls of an existing castle. The illusory wall must be continuous (it cannot form two or more shorter walls), but it can follow any corners or bends that the caster desires.
In addition to the wall, the spell creates the illusion of constant movement among the crenellations, as if defending troops were moving atop the wall. The formation of the crenellations makes it impossible for a distant observer to determine exactly how many and what types of defenders are present on the illusory fortification.
The illusory wall remains in existence for 2d12 hours unless the spell is terminated earlier.
The spell has one very significant limitation: it is strictly two-dimensional and is visible from only one side (the side that the caster deems to be the \"outside\"). When viewed from the outside, the wall appears real; when viewed from the end, from above, or from the \"inside,\" the wall is totally invisible except for a faint outline of the shape of the wall. This means that friendly troops, concealed from enemy view by the illusory wall, can see their opponents clearly. The wall is most effective if friendly troops are informed of the wall's presence and are careful not to walk through the illusion. Such an occurrence does not end the spell, but it will probably advise the enemy of the nature of the wall.
Spells cast at the wall and shots fired at the illusory fortification by siege engines appear to strike the wall and inflict normal damage. In reality, the missiles or spells pass through the illusion, possibly striking troops or real fortifications beyond. Such \"hits\" do not disturb the illusion.
As soon as an enemy unit moves within 10 yards of the illusory fortification, the spell terminates and the wall vanishes.
There are two ways in which the spell can be terminated before it expires. First, the priest can terminate the spell at any time. Second, if a friendly unit makes an attack, whether melee or missile combat, through the illusory wall from the \"inside\" to the \"outside,\" the spell terminates instantly.
Once the illusory fortification has been created, the priest does not need to concentrate on the wall. The spell remains in effect even if the casting priest is killed in the interim.
The material components are the priest's holy symbol, a handful of stones, powdered mortar, and a gem worth at least 3,000 gp. All components except the holy symbol are consumed in the casting."}</textarea>

Shadow engines are accompanied by illusory crews of the appropriate number and race. The engines can move at a rate of 20 yards per turn and are unaffected by terrain considerations. (The caster can choose to slow them when passing through rough terrain to aid the illusion of reality.) Shadow engines cannot carry real troops. They can be fired at the same rate as real engines of the appropriate type, but a hit causes only one-half the damage normal for that type of engine (round fractions down).
A shadow engine remains in existence until the spell duration expires, until an enemy unit approaches within 10 yards, or until it suffers damage from an enemy missile attack.
When any of these conditions occur, the engine vanishes. If a single spell has created multiple engines, only the engine struck vanishes; the others remain.
The crew associated with a shadow engine must remain with that engine; it cannot move more than 5 yards away from the engine itself.
Shadow engines can move independently of other engines created by the spell as long as they remain within the area of effect and remain within 240 yards of the caster. The caster must maintain concentration to control the shadow engines. He cannot cast any other spells, and he is limited to a movement rate of 6. If the caster is struck for damage, the shadow engines vanish.

				<div class="description-content">A priest may cast warband quest on any group of 200 creatures who are capable of understanding his commands. The creatures are then affected in a manner similar to the 5th-level priest spell, quest. Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw with a -4 penalty to avoid the effects.<br />The specified quest must be related to the reason that the Power granted this spell (perhaps a quest to slay or overcome a specified enemy).<br />Warband quest gives subjects of the spell a bonus of 2 hp per level of the caster (maximum 20 hp). Subjects also gain the effects of a prayer spell and have Morale of 18 while on the quest. These benefits last for the duration of the spell; the spell ends when the specified task is completed. A creature who abandons the quest is subject to the wrath of his deity.</div>
