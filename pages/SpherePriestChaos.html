"description":"This spell alters the appearance of words written in ink. When the spell is cast upon a written page, the ink imperceptibly begins to move. Over the next few days, the message becomes progressively more illegible. If the page is left undisturbed for six days, an entirely new message forms on the page. The new message is completely legible and is recognizable as the handwriting of the original author, but is contrary in content to the original message.
After the spell is cast, the message will appear different every day. The DM decides the message that the page will carry after the sixth day has passed. Following is a sample of the changes that could take place in a message.
Day One: The words of the letter appear faint, as if the author of the letter was running out of ink as he wrote.
Day Two: The words have moved slightly from their original positions, as if the person writing the letter were shaking or in a moving carriage when the letter was written.
Days Three and Four: The message is gibberish. Although the ink forms groups of letters arranged in lines with punctuation, nearly all the words are meaningless. This may appear to be some sort of code, but it means nothing.
Day Five: The ink has formed real words. However, the sentence construction is still meaningless (e.g., Egg west worse green!).
Day Six (and beyond): The message is coherent, but the opposite intent of the original message has been created. If the original letter read, \"Send troops quickly,\" the new letter reads, \"All is fine. Keep your men in reserve.\" If mistaken missive is cast on the pages of a spellbook or a scroll, the ink on the page reforms into a new spell of the same level as the original spell. Thus, a darkness spell might become a maze spell. However, the spell formula will be wrong. Although it will look like a proper spell, it will not function when cast.
A coded message that is subjected to mistaken missive will appear as a coded message on the sixth day but will hold a different meaning than the original message.
A glass of preserved words will allow the original message to be read correctly.
Dispel magic will restore the message to its original form.
The material component is three drops of ink."}</textarea>

The spell is cast on any one quantity of food; thus, the priest could cast the spell on the batter of a wedding cake, or he could cast the spell on a quantity of onions as they are diced for both a salad and a stew. The spell affects 10 pounds of food per level of the caster. Anyone who eats the affected food (even a character who eats the salad but not the stew) is subject to the effects of the spell.
The effects of the spell begin five rounds after the food has been eaten. At that time, creatures who have eaten the affected food are allowed a saving throw; success indicates that a creature is not affected.
Affected creatures quickly become agitated. Petty events ranging from poor table manners to loud talking bother everyone. After five minutes, tempers flare, characters feel compelled to shout at and insult one another, and threats are hurled. Even normally calm characters will feel compelled to vent their frustrations violently.
Creatures maintain no alliances while under the effect of dissension's feast. A king and his wife who are normally madly in love will find themselves bickering with each other in a matter of minutes. Members of a diplomatic delegation might come to blows with each other within minutes of eating the food.

"description":"Miscast magic can be cast only on a wizard. It causes the next spell cast by the affected wizard to be chosen randomly from his memorized spells of the same or lower level. Thus, if a wizard affected by miscast magic had four 1st-level spells memorized ( armor, feather fall, jump, and sleep) and he attempted to cast the sleep spell, the DM would determine the resulting spell randomly from the wizard's four memorized spells.
The wizard has only a 25% chance of casting the sleep spell.
Only spells currently memorized are eligible to be exchanged with the desired spell.
If a wizard had only one spell memorized, the miscast magic would have no effect and the wizard's spell would be cast normally.
The miscast spell operates normally. If a wizard tried to levitate a companion but a web spell resulted, the companion would be trapped by the webs and subject to all resulting effects. If the target of the spell were in range of the levitate spell but not in range of the web, the spell would be lost in a fizzle of energy and the web spell would be wiped from the caster's memory.
The wizard who casts the spell performs the proper verbal and somatic components of the spell he wishes to cast; he does not discover the altered results until the wrong spell takes effect. The wizard will also discover that the material component for the resulting spell has vanished (in addition to the material component for the desired spell).
Wizards who are targets of miscast magic are allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect."}</textarea>

Thus, if a wizard affected by miscast magic had four 1st-level spells memorized ( armor, feather fall, jump, and sleep) and he attempted to cast the sleep spell, the DM would determine the resulting spell randomly from the wizard&#039;s four memorized spells.<br />The wizard has only a 25% chance of casting the sleep spell.<br />Only spells currently memorized are eligible to be exchanged with the desired spell.<br />If a wizard had only one spell memorized, the miscast magic would have no effect and the wizard&#039;s spell would be cast normally.<br />The miscast spell operates normally. If a wizard tried to levitate a companion but a web spell resulted, the companion would be trapped by the webs and subject to all resulting effects. If the target of the spell were in range of the levitate spell but not in range of the web, the spell would be lost in a fizzle of energy and the web spell would be wiped from the caster&#039;s memory.<br />The wizard who casts the spell performs the proper verbal and somatic components of the spell he wishes to cast; he does not discover the altered results until the wrong spell takes effect. The wizard will also discover that the material component for the resulting spell has vanished (in addition to the material component for the desired spell).<br />Wizards who are targets of miscast magic are allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect.</div>

"description":"This spell creates a rift in the nature of cause and effect. The spell is cast upon an opponent's weapon.

Instead, the person wielding the weapon or one of his companions suffers the damage. If the weapon misses its target on any round, no damage is caused in that round.
Using a die roll, the DM randomly determines the victim of the damage. The DM selects a die with a value nearest the number of eligible creatures (the wielder of the weapon and his companions). If the number of creatures does not equate to highest value of a die, the wielder of the enchanted weapon takes the extra chances to be hit. For example, if a goblin wields a sword affected by this spell, he and his six companions are eligible to receive the damage. The DM rolls 1d8. On a roll of 1-6, one of the goblin's companions suffers the damage; on a roll of 7 or 8, the goblin with the affected weapon suffers the damage.
The weapon is affected for 3 rounds+1 round/level of the spell caster. If the wielder of the weapon changes weapons while the spell is in effect, the discarded weapon remains enchanted.

"description":"After casting this spell, the priest must successfully touch his victim. The victim is then allowed a saving throw to avoid the spell's effect. If the saving throw is failed, the spell takes effect at the next sunrise or sunset (whichever comes first).
From the time the spell takes effect until the spell is negated, the sleeping pattern of the victim is randomly disrupted. At sunset and sunrise of every day, a check is made to determine the effects of chaotic sleep. In the 12-hour period that follows the check, there is an equal chance that the character will be unable to sleep or unable to remain awake (roll 1d6; on a roll of 1-3, the character is awake, on a roll of 4-6, he sleeps). This condition lasts until the next sunrise (or sunset) when the check is made again.
For example, a fighter fails to save against chaotic sleep. For the next few hours, the spell has no effect. At sundown, the first check is made, resulting in a 2. The fighter does not notice anything until he tries to sleep that night, at which time he is wide awake, fidgeting and restless. At sunrise, another die roll is made, resulting in a 6. The fighter is suddenly exhausted and sleeps until sunset.
Characters who sleep as a result of this spell can be roused only by physical stimuli--a slap or a wound, for example. Once awake, the character remains conscious only as long as there are active stimuli around him, such as a fight. Walking through caves or riding a horse will not keep the character awake. Unlike a sleep spell, characters affected by chaotic sleep doze off as soon as they are left relatively undisturbed. Keeping an affected character awake is difficult at best.
Lack of sleep will eventually take a physical toll on any character under the influence of the spell. For every 12-hour period that a character remains awake beyond the first, he suffers a -1 penalty to THAC0. Such characters do not regain hit points as a result of normal healing. Spellcasters cannot memorize spells until they have had sufficient sleep.
Chaotic sleep can be removed with a remove curse.
The material components are a pinch of sand and three coffee beans."}</textarea>

"description":"This potent defense surrounds the caster in a chaotic maelstrom of energy and demimatter that blocks or deflects many attacks. The entropy shield extends about two feet in all directions from the caster's body. The warping effect of the field causes any melee or hand-to-hand attack to miss 50% of the time-even if the roll allows an attack to continue, the priest still gains a -2 bonus to his Armor Class. Normal missiles or hurled weapons miss automatically as the entropy shield deflects them from the caster.
Even magical missile attacks (produce flame, magic missile, or Melf's acid arrow, for example), siege engines, and giant-thrown boulders may be deflected as if they were hand-to-hand attacks.
Against spells or effects that produce energy, gas, or other physical attack forms (fireball, lightning bolt, cloudkill, and other such spells) the entropy shield provides a 50% chance that the attack simply does not affect the protected priest. Even if the harmful energy or matter penetrates the shield, the caster gains a +2 bonus on his saving throw. This does not cause a spell to fizzle or fail; a priest standing in the middle of a fireball is simply not touched by the spell, which will inflict its normal damage on anyone else in the area of effect. Any spell or effect that does not create matter or energy Entropy Shield to harm or hinder the victim can pass through the entropy shield normally, so mind-based attacks and magical effects such as petrification, paralyzation, enfeeblement, or polymorph (to name a few) can still affect the priest.
In addition to its defensive benefits, the entropy shield has the ability to repel normal or giant-sized animals and creatures of lawful alignment, such as extraplanar monsters from the lawful planes. Any such creature attempting to attack the shielded priest in hand-to-hand combat must roll a saving throw vs. spell at the end of the round. If the creature fails, it recoils from the priest and cannot attack him physically for the remainder of the spell's duration (although it could decide to turn on one of the priest's companions).

"description":"This spell allows the caster to summon weather that is either appropriate or inappropriate to the climate and season of the region. The summoned effects are always dramatic--cool breezes or light fog will not appear. Instead, torrential floods will assault a desert, a heat wave will rage in polar wastelands, and tornadoes and hurricanes will rip across gentle landscapes. A blizzard might spring up in summer or a tornado might materialize in the winter.
The spellcaster has no influence over the weather pattern that emerges. He cannot control the area of effect or the duration of the weather.
Four turns after the spell is cast, the trend of the weather will become apparent--a sudden chill, gust of wind, overcast sky, etc. The uncontrolled weather arrives on the fifth turn. Once the weather has arrived, it cannot be dispelled. If the spell is canceled by the caster before the beginning of the fifth turn, the weather slowly reverts to its original condition.
The effects of the spell are the decision of the DM. The effects should be grand and impressive. Following are suggested effects of the weather.
Torrential Rain/Blizzard: Visibility is reduced to 100 yards or less; travel is nearly impossible due to water or heavy snow on the ground.
Storm/Hurricanes: All flying creatures are driven from the skies; trees are uprooted; roofs are torn off; ships are endangered.
Heat Wave: Intense heat immediately causes ice bridges to melt; avalanches of snow and ice roll down mountains.
The DM determines the area of effect randomly. The maximum duration of the spell is one turn per level of the caster; however, the DM may cancel the effect after a shorter time."}</textarea>

"description":"This powerful spell affects all enemies of the spellcasting priest who enter the area of effect. The spell inflicts a -2 penalty on saving throws, a -1 penalty to armor class, and a - 1 penalty to attack and damage rolls. Creatures friendly to the cleric gain corresponding bonuses--+2 to saving throws, +1 to attack and damage rolls, and a bonus of 1 to AC.
Additional effects are possible, depending on the Power granting the spell; effects must correspond (or at least not conflict) with the spheres the priest normally uses. Multiple effects are possible.
The variation for the Sphere of Wards requires that each hostile creature entering the area of effect make a saving throw vs. spells with a -4 penalty or suffer 4d6 points of damage. An affected creature must then flee the area; it is unable to return. The creature must make a second saving throw vs. spell with a -4 penalty as it leaves the area or be blinded until magically cured.
The variation for the sphere of Law requires that a hostile creature make a saving throw every time it wishes to change an action. Thus, if a creature wishes to stop running and draw a weapon, a successful save is needed or the creature continues to run. Actions that cannot be continued (e.g., firing an arrow if the archer has no more arrows) are repeated as empty automatisms. In addition, creatures hostile to the priest automatically fail saving throws against Enchantment/Charm spells cast by the priest.
The variation for the Sphere of Chaos requires that hostile creatures make saving throws vs. spells at -4 or be affected by confusion (as per the spell). Affected creatures have a 5% chance per round of suddenly being attacked by a phantasmal killer.
All creatures who enter the area of effect are subject to the effects of the spell. All effects except blindness cease 3 rounds after an affected creature leaves the area.
Creatures reentering the area of effect must make new saving throws."}</textarea>

"description":"This potent spell affects all creatures hostile to the priest within the area of effect. The Power granting the spell causes the spell's effects to manifest in one of two ways: the Chaos variation or the Thought variation.
In the Chaos variation, the fabric of reality is altered to change events. Magical items dysfunction because the fabric of magical reality is changed.
In the Thought variation, the thoughts of the victims of the spell are distorted and altered so that they find themselves unable to function coherently and effectively.
Magical items dysfunction because the thoughts of their users are warped to either convince them that the items cannot function or block thought so that proper commands cannot be given.
The effects on the victims of the spell are the same for both variations. Each round, there is a 50% chance that a degeneration effect will occur in the area of effect. When this occurs, two events take place. First, spellcasters lose one spell from each level of spell currently memorized (e.g., a spellcaster who has memorized three spells each from levels 1 through 3 loses one spell from each level for a total of three). Lost spells may be regained normally through rest and memorization.
