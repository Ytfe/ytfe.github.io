Magical spells and invocations are not recorded, so this spell can't be used to create a backup copy of a scroll even as it's read by the wizard, but a clever wizard may be able to record a magical item's command word if an enemy within ranges uses it while the spell is in effect.

The shield also adds a +1 bonus to the wizards saving throws against attacks that are basically frontal. <br /><br />Note that these benefits apply only if the attacks originate from in front of the wizard, where the shield can move to interpose itself.</div>

"description":"A web spell creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points - floor and ceiling, opposite walls, etc., or the web collapses upon itself and disappears.

The web spell covers a maximum area of eight 10' x 10' x 10' cubes and the webs must be at least 10 feet thick, so a mass 40 feet high, 20 feet wide, and 10 feet deep may be cast. Creatures caught within webs, or simply touching them, become stuck among the gluey fibers. 

Anyone in the area when the spell is cast must roll a saving throw vs. spell with a -2 penalty. If the saving throw is successful, two things may have occurred. If the creature has room to escape the area, then it is assumed to have jumped free. If there is no room to escape, then the webs are only half strength. Creatures with less than 13 Strength (7 if the webs are half strength) are stuck until freed by another or until the spell wears off. Missile fire is generally ineffective against creatures trapped in webs.

Creatures with Strengths between 13 and 17 can break through 1 foot of webs per round. Creatures with 18 or greater Strength can break through 2 feet of webs per round. If the webs are at half strength, these rates are doubled. (Great mass equates to great strength in this case, and creatures of large mass hardly notice webs.) Strong and huge creatures can break through 10 feet of webs per round.

Furthermore, the strands of a web spell are flammable. A magical flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire - torch, flaming oil, flaming sword, etc. - can set them alight and burn them away in a single round. All creatures within flaming webs suffer 2d4 points of damage from the flames, but those free of the strands are not harmed.

"description":"Upon casting this spell, the wizard releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy that inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level of the spellcaster (maximum damage of 10d6) to each creature within its area of effect. A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces this damage to half (round fractions down).

The bolt begins at a range and height decided by the caster and streaks outward in a direct line from the casting wizard (e.g., if a 40-foot bolt was started at 180 feet from the wizard, the far end of bolt would reach 220 feet (180 + 40). 

The lightning bolt may set fire to combustibles, sunder wooden doors, splinter up to 1/2 foot thickness of stone, and melt metals with a low melting point (lead, gold, copper, silver, bronze). 

Saving throws must be rolled for objects that withstand the full force of a stroke (see the fireball spell). If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it (i.e., the saving throw fails), the bolt continues. A bolt can breach one inch of wood or 1/2 inch of stone per caster level up to a maximum of one foot of wood or 1/2 foot of stone. 

The lightning bolt's area of effect is chosen by the spellcaster: either a forked bolt 10 feet wide and 40 feet long or a single bolt five feet wide and 80 feet long. If a bolt cannot reach its full length, because of an unyielding barrier (such as a stone wall), the lightning bolt rebounds from the barrier toward its caster, ending only when it reaches its full length.

Example: An 80-foot-long stroke is begun at a range of 40 feet, but it hits a stone wall at 50 feet. The bolt travels 10 feet, hits the wall, and rebounds for 70 feet back toward its creator (who is only 50 feet from the wall, and so is caught in his own lightning bolt!).

The DM might allow reflecting bolts. When this type of lightning bolt strikes a solid surface, the bolt reflects from the surface at an angle equal to the angle of incidence (like light off a mirror). A creature crossed more than once by the bolt must roll a saving throw for every time it is crossed, but it still suffers either full damage (if one saving throw is missed) or half damage (if all saving throws are made).

The material components of the spell are a bit of fur and an amber, crystal, or glass rod."}</textarea>

It can also ignite combustible materials (even solid planks). 

The meteors are treated as missiles hurled by the wizard with a +2 bonus to the attack rolls and with no penalty for range. Misses are treated as grenade-like missiles that inflict 1 point of damage to creatures within three feet.

The spell can be cast in either of two ways:

A) The wizard discharges five meteors every round (see the \"Multiple Attacks and Initiative\" section in Chapter 9: Combat). Note that this carries over into at least the following round.

B) The wizard discharges only one meteor per round. In addition to releasing the missile, the caster can perform other actions in the round, including spellcasting, melee, or device use. Spells requiring concentration force the wizard to forgo the rest of the missiles to maintain concentration. 

Also, if the wizard fails to maintain an exact mental count of the number of missiles he has remaining, he has involuntarily lost the remaining portion of the spell.

The spell ends when the caster has fired off as many meteors as he has experience levels, when he forgoes casting any still remaining, or when a successful dispel magic spell is thrown upon the caster.

The components necessary for the casting of this spell are niter and sulphur formed into a bead by the addition of pine tar. The caster must also have a small hollow tube of minute proportion, fashioned from gold. The tube costs no less than 1,000 gp to construct, so fine is its workmanship and magical engraving, and it can be reused."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell calls into being a curtain or field of water that remains intact and upright in defiance of gravity. The wall lasts as long as the wizard chooses to concentrate on maintaining it or one round per level if the wizard chooses not to concentrate on holding it together. The caster may shape the wall of water in one of three ways:

A. Water Curtain. In this form, the wizard conjures one plane of water, 5 feet square and 1 foot thick, per experience level; for example, a 5th-level caster can create five 5-foot x 5-foot x 1-foot wall sections that would be enough to block an arched passageway 15 feet wide and 10 feet high with a curtain of water 1 foot thick. The curtain's lower edge must rest upon the ground, but need not be anchored on either side, and it remains cohesive and upright for the duration of the spell. Once raised, the wall cannot be moved.

B. Hemisphere. In this manifestation, the wall of water forms a dome 1 foot thick over the caster, with an inner radius equal to 3 feet plus 1 foot per caster level; a 7th level caster could create a dome with a 10 foot radius. The wall must rest upon the ground. The dome is immobile.

C. Sphere. If cast underwater, the caster may shape the wall of water into a sphere 1 foot thick, with an inner radius equal to 3 feet plus 1 foot per caster level (no air is in the sphere). The sphere is centered on the caster and moves with him.

In any form, the wall of water has two primary effects. First of all, missile fire through the wall is next to impossible, suffering a -4 attack penalty for each foot of thickness as well as -1 damage penalty for every two feet of thickness. Creatures gain a +1 bonus to saving throws against attack spells that must pass through the wall. If the spell allows no saving throw, none is granted by the wall of water. Secondly, physical passage through the wall is hindered; any creature trying to pass through must take one full round to do so and becomes soaked to the skin in the process. The wall of water can be defeated or bypassed by a number of spells or effects. At the end of the spell's duration, the water loses its cohesiveness and collapses, which may surprise those sheltering under the hemisphere or standing next to the curtain. Note the water itself may be fresh water (25% chance), salt water (50% chance) or brackish (25% chance), although the sphere will always be composed of the water type that surrounds it. The material component is a vial full of blessed spring water."}</textarea>

"description":"This spell can be cast in one of two forms: a warm shield that protects against cold-based attacks, or a chill shield that protects against fire-based attacks.

The color of the flames is determined randomly (50% chance of either color) - blue or green if the chill shield is cast, violet or blue if the warm shield is employed. The special powers of each shield are as follows:

A) Warmshield. The flames are warm to the touch. Any cold-based attacks are saved against with a +2 bonus; either half normal damage or no damage is sustained. There is no bonus against fire-based attacks, but if the wizard fails to make the required saving throw (if any) against them, he sustains double normal damage.

The material component for this variation is a bit of phosphorus.

B) Chill shield. The flames are cool to the touch. Any fire-based attacks are saved against with a +2 bonus; either half normal damage or no damage is sustained. There is no bonus against cold-based attacks, but if the wizard fails to make the required saving throw (if any) against them, he sustains double normal damage.

The material component for this variation is a live firefly or glow worm or the tail portions of four dead ones.

Any creature striking the spellcaster with its body or hand-held weapons inflicts normal damage upon the wizard, but the attacker suffers the same amount of damage. An attacker's magical resistance, if any, is tested when the creature actually strikes the wizard. Successful resistance shatters the spell. Failure means the creature's magic resistance does not affect that casting of the spell.

"description":"Any closeable item (book, box, bottle, chest, coffer, coffin, door, drawer, and so forth) can be warded by a fire trap spell. The spell is centered on a point selected by the spellcaster. The item so trapped cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed upon it (if such is attempted, the result is 25% first spell fails, 25% second spell fails, or 50% both spells fail). 

A knock spell does not affect fire trap in any way - as soon as the offending party enters or touches the item, the trap discharges. Thieves and others have only 1/2 of their normal chance to detect a fire trap (by noticing the characteristic markings required to cast the spell). They have only 1/2 of their normal chance to remove the trap (failure detonates the trap immediately). An unsuccessful dispel does not detonate the spell. 

The caster can use the trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the spe11 was specifically attuned when cast (the exact method usually involves a keyword). 

When the trap is discharged, there is an explosion of five-foot radius from the spell's center; all creatures within this area must roll saving throws vs. spell. Damage is 1d4 points plus 1 point per level of the caster; half this (round up) for creatures successfully saving. (Underwater, this ward inflicts half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.) The item trapped is not harmed by this explosion.

To place this spell, the caster must trace the outline of the closure with a bit of sulphur or saltpeter and touch the center of the effect. Attunement to another individual requires a hair or similar object from that person.

				<div class="description-content">Any closeable item (book, box, bottle, chest, coffer, coffin, door, drawer, and so forth) can be warded by a fire trap spell. The spell is centered on a point selected by the spellcaster. The item so trapped cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed upon it (if such is attempted, the result is 25% first spell fails, 25% second spell fails, or 50% both spells fail). <br /><br />A knock spell does not affect fire trap in any way - as soon as the offending party enters or touches the item, the trap discharges. Thieves and others have only 1/2 of their normal chance to detect a fire trap (by noticing the characteristic markings required to cast the spell). They have only 1/2 of their normal chance to remove the trap (failure detonates the trap immediately). An unsuccessful dispel does not detonate the spell. <br /><br />The caster can use the trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the spe11 was specifically attuned when cast (the exact method usually involves a keyword). <br /><br />When the trap is discharged, there is an explosion of five-foot radius from the spell&#039;s center; all creatures within this area must roll saving throws vs. spell. Damage is 1d4 points plus 1 point per level of the caster; half this (round up) for creatures successfully saving. (Underwater, this ward inflicts half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.) The item trapped is not harmed by this explosion.<br /><br />To place this spell, the caster must trace the outline of the closure with a bit of sulphur or saltpeter and touch the center of the effect. Attunement to another individual requires a hair or similar object from that person.<br /></div>

Any creature breaking through the ice suffers 2 points of damage per inch of thickness of the wall. Fire-using creatures suffer 3 points of damage per inch, while cold using creatures suffer only 1 point of damage per inch when breaking through. The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored along one or more sides.

B) Hemisphere. This casting of the spell creates a hemisphere whose maximum radius is equal to 3 feet plus 1 foot per caster level. Thus, a 7th-level caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius. The hemisphere lasts until it is broken, dispelled, or melted. Note that it is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents under the hemisphere.

C) Ice sheet. This casting of the spell causes a horizontal sheet to fall upon opponents. The sheet covers a 10-foot-square area per caster level. The sheet has the same effect as an ice storm's hail stones - 3d10 points of damage inflicted to creatures beneath it.

A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures; its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Magical fires such as fireballs and fiery dragon breath melt a wall of ice in one round, though this creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts one turn. Normal fires or lesser magical ones do not hasten the melting of a wall of ice.

The material component of this spell is a small piece of quartz or similar rock crystal."}</textarea>

The size of the hand is determined by the wizard, and it can be from human size (5 feet) all the way up to titan size (25 feet).

On the second round, a 7'-tall, multicolored tornado appears. From this moment on, the caster must maintain concentration in order for the vortex to remain.

Each round, the caster can move the vortex 60 feet. However, control of direction is not perfect. The caster has complete control over distance, but can only suggest the desired direction. The caster has a 50% chance of moving the vortex in the direction he desires; if the die roll indicates failure, the vortex moves according to the scatter diagram for grenade-like missiles. Thus, the vortex usually moves in the general direction desired, but on occasion, it may move to either side or directly toward the caster.

The vortex cannot pass through objects larger than its area of effect (it could move through a sapling but not an ancient oak tree) and will be redirected by these, rebounding along the general line of movement. For example, if cast in a narrow hallway, the vortex might ricochet down the hall, bouncing from side to side.

The vortex is composed of raw magical energy. Nonmagical creatures struck by the vortex suffer 1d4 points of damage per level of the caster. Magical creatures and spellcasters suffer 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster. Creatures struck are allowed a saving throw vs. magic to suffer only half damage.

Each time a creature is struck, there is a 5% chance that the vortex will explode in a wild surge. Use Table 2 to determine the results of any wild surge. If the vortex causes a wild surge, the spell ends immediately.

The material components are a silk streamer and a handful of straw."}</textarea>

The caster has a 50% chance of moving the vortex in the direction he desires; if the die roll indicates failure, the vortex moves according to the scatter diagram for grenade-like missiles. Thus, the vortex usually moves in the general direction desired, but on occasion, it may move to either side or directly toward the caster.<br /><br />The vortex cannot pass through objects larger than its area of effect (it could move through a sapling but not an ancient oak tree) and will be redirected by these, rebounding along the general line of movement. For example, if cast in a narrow hallway, the vortex might ricochet down the hall, bouncing from side to side.<br /><br />The vortex is composed of raw magical energy. Nonmagical creatures struck by the vortex suffer 1d4 points of damage per level of the caster. Magical creatures and spellcasters suffer 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster. Creatures struck are allowed a saving throw vs. magic to suffer only half damage.<br /><br />Each time a creature is struck, there is a 5% chance that the vortex will explode in a wild surge. Use Table 2 to determine the results of any wild surge. If the vortex causes a wild surge, the spell ends immediately.<br /><br />The material components are a silk streamer and a handful of straw.</div>

Unlike a lightning bolt spell, chain lightning strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to a series of other objects or creatures within range, losing energy with each jump.

The bolt initially inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 12d6 (half damage if the object or creature rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell). After the first strike, the lightning arcs to the next nearest object or creature. Each jump reduces the strength of the lightning by 1d6. Each creature or magical object hit receives a saving throw vs. spell. Success on this save indicates the creature suffers only half damage from the bolt.

The chain can strike as many times (including the first object or creature) as the spellcaster has levels, although each creature or object can be struck only once. Thus, a bolt cast by a 12th-level wizard can strike up to 12 times, causing less damage with each strike. The bolt continues to arc until it has struck the appropriate number of objects or
creatures, until it strikes an object that grounds it (interconnecting iron bars of a large cell or cage, a large pool of liquid, etc.), or until there are no more objects or creatures to strike.

Direction is not a consideration when plotting chain lightning arcs. Distance is a factor- -an arc cannot exceed the spell's range. If the only possible arc is greater than the spell's range, the stroke fades into nothingness. Creatures immune to electrical attack can be struck, even though no damage is taken. Note that it is possible for the chain to arc back to the caster!

"description":"By means of this spell, the wizard is able to place another spell upon his person so that the latter spell will come into effect under the conditions dictated during the casting of the contingency spell. The contingency spell and the spell it is to bring into effect are cast at the same time (the one-turn casting time indicated is the total for both castings).

The spell to be brought into effect by the prescribed contingency must be one that affects the wizard's person (feather fall, levitation, fly, feign death, etc.) and be of a spell level no higher than 1/3 of the caster's experience level (rounded down), but not higher than the 6th spell level. (See book for table ).

Only one contingency spell can be placed on the spellcaster at any one time; if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is cancelled. The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be rather general. For example, a contingency spell cast with an airy water spell might prescribe that any time the wizard is plunged into or otherwise engulfed in water or similar liquid, the airy water spell will instantly come into effect. Or a contingency could bring a feather fall spell into effect any time the wizard falls more than 2 feet. In all cases, the contingency immediately brings into effect the second spell, the latter being \"cast\" instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. Note that if complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell complex (the contingency spell and the companion magic) may fail when called upon.

The material components of this spell are (in addition to those of the companion spell) 100gp worth of quicksilver and an eyelash of an ogre mage, ki-rin, or similar spell-using creature. In addition, the spell requires a statuette of the wizard carved from elephant ivory (which is not destroyed, though it is subject to wear and tear), which must be carried on the person of the spellcaster for the contingency spell to perform its function when called upon."}</textarea>

For example, a contingency spell cast with an airy water spell might prescribe that any time the wizard is plunged into or otherwise engulfed in water or similar liquid, the airy water spell will instantly come into effect. Or a contingency could bring a feather fall spell into effect any time the wizard falls more than 2 feet. In all cases, the contingency immediately brings into effect the second spell, the latter being &quot;cast&quot; instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. Note that if complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell complex (the contingency spell and the companion magic) may fail when called upon.<br /><br />The material components of this spell are (in addition to those of the companion spell) 100gp worth of quicksilver and an eyelash of an ogre mage, ki-rin, or similar spell-using creature. In addition, the spell requires a statuette of the wizard carved from elephant ivory (which is not destroyed, though it is subject to wear and tear), which must be carried on the person of the spellcaster for the contingency spell to perform its function when called upon.</div>

"description":"This spell makes a single weapon incredibly sharp by reducing one of its physical dimensions to an infinitesimal measurement. The dimensional blade can slash through matter with as much effort as it takes to wave a stick through the air. Even stone and iron can be carved to pieces with ease. The spell can be cast on almost any hand-held slashing (type S) weapon, as well as a few thrown weapons of this type, such as the chakram, shuriken, or a hand axe.

Against creatures, the dimensional blade ignores any portion of Armor Class derived from armor itself; only magical and Dexterity adjustments affect the opponent's AC. For example, a warrior in chain mail +2 with a Dexterity of 17 is normally AC 20, but against the dimensional blade he only applies the 3-point adjustment for Dexterity and the 2-point magical adjustment, for a total AC of 15. Creatures wearing purely magical armor (such as bracers of defense) may keep the full magical adjustment. Monsters with thick or toughened hides, such as dragons, may lose part of the Armor Class at the DM's discretion. The weapon gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls in any event, but the wielder ignores any Strength-based combat adjustments-muscle power doesn't help the blade at all.

The dimensional blade is also quite effective against inanimate objects. Any object with a diameter or thickness smaller than the blades length must make a saving throw vs. disintegration when struck, or be cleanly severed in twain. Larger objects can be sawed through or sliced away at the rate of about 5 cubic feet per round. It's dangerous to attempt to disarm a dimensional blade; the weapon used must make an item saving throw vs. disintegration or be destroyed.

Finally, the blade is also effective against phased or ethereal creatures since part of its existence is forced into the Ethereal Plane. If the wielder has some way to detect creatures concealed in this way, the blade can strike and affect them normally, but without the power to negate Armor Class or other combat bonuses.

The wizard must touch the weapon to be affected by the spell, but afterward anyone may wield it. The material component for this spell is a razor-thin shard of glass."}</textarea>

Creatures within the area of effect of the spell are caught and contained unless they are able to pass through the openings--and, of course, all spells and breath weapons can pass through the gaps in the bars of force of the forcecage.

A creature with magic resistance has a single attempt to pass through the walls of the cage. If the resistance check is successful, the creature escapes. If it fails, the creature is caged. Note that a successful check does not destroy the cage, nor does it enable other creatures (save familiars) to flee with the escaping creature. The forcecage is also unlike the solid-walled protective device, cube of force, in that it can be gotten rid of only by means of a dispel magic spell or by the expiration of the spell.

By means of special preparation at the time of memorization, a forcecage spell can be altered to a forcecube spell. The cube created is 10 feet on a side, and the spell then resembles that of a cube of force in all respects save that of the differences between a cast spell and the magic of a device, including the methods of defeating its power.

Although the actual casting of either application of the spell requires no material component, the study required to commit it to memory does demand that the wizard powder a diamond of at least 1,000 gp value, using the diamond dust to trace the outlines of the cage or cube he desires to create via spellcasting at some later time. Thus, in memorization, the diamond dust is employed and expended, for upon completion of study, the wizard must then toss the dust into the air and it will disappear."}</textarea>

"description":"Related to both the contingency and permanency spells, persistence allows a wizard to cast a spell of 6th level or lower and then hold it until it is needed. There are two general uses for persistence: to use a personal spell effect as needed up to the maximum duration of the persistence itself, or to prepare an instantaneous spell and hold it ready until the caster wishes to use it.

A. Personal effect. Any spell that augments the wizard’s natural abilities - detect magic, protection from evil, jump, infravision, fly, wraithform, or other caster-affecting spells-can be made persistent by use of this spell. The wizard casts persistence and then immediately follows with the desired spell. Instead of taking effect immediately, the magic of the persistence holds it ready for use by a simple act of will. The wizard can then “turn on” or “turn off” the girded spell as often as he likes over the course of the duration of the persistence. The duration of the girded spell only runs while the spell is active, so a 15th-level wizard who makes a fly spell persistent will be able to use 1d6+15 turns of flight (the normal duration of fly) over the next 15 days (the duration of the persistence) as he sees fit.

This is especially useful because it allows the wizard to cast the girded spell and the persistence and have the girded spell’s effects available while he then memorizes another spell in place of the spell made persistent. It is also useful because the girded spell can be activated instantly by an act of will. The main difference between this spell and contingency lies in the fact that a persistent spell may be invoked several times (up to the limit of its normal duration) while a contingency functions once only.

B. Held spell. Spells that have an instantaneous effect, such as most attack spells and some movement spells like teleport or dimension door, can be rendered persistent as well. The held spell may be activated or discharged at any time during the duration of the persistence, but its magic is then exhausted as if it had been cast normally. This resembles the effect of a contingency spell, but the effect has no predefined conditions and simply occurs when the caster wills it to.

Damaging or offensive spells that have a duration (for example, flaming sphere or wall of fire) cannot be rendered persistent. A wizard may have no more than one persistence spell active at any given time; if he girds a new spell while an old one is still persistent, the old spell is simply replaced by the new one. The material component is a crystal chalice of exquisite workmanship worth at least 2,000 gp. The material component of a held or girded spell is expended when the spell is made persistent."}</textarea>

"description":"  By means of the astral spell, a wizard can project his astral body into the Astral Plane, leaving his physical body and material possessions behind in the Prime Material Plane. Only magical items can be brought into the Astral Plane (although nonmagical items could be rendered temporarily magical through the use of some spells, if the DM allows).
As the Astral Plane touches upon the first levels of all of the Outer Planes, the wizard can travel astrally to any of the Outer Planes at will. The caster then leaves the Astral Plane, forming a body in the plane of existence he has chosen to enter. It is also possible to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime Material Plane by means of the astral spell, but a second body cannot be formed in the Prime Material Plane. As a general rule, a person astrally projected can be seen only by creatures in the Astral Plane.
   At all times, the astral body is connected to the material body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the affected person is killed, astrally and materially; however, normally only a psychic wind can cause the cord to break. When a second body is formed in a different plane, the silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to the original body where it rests in the Prime Material Plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation.
   Although astrally projected persons are able to function in the Astral Plane, their actions do not affect creatures not existing in the Astral Plane. The spell lasts until the wizard desires to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means (such as a dispel magic spell or the destruction of the wizard's body in the Prime Material Plane).
   The wizard can project the astral forms of up to seven other creatures with him by means of the astral spell, providing the creatures are linked in a circle with the wizard. These fellow travelers are dependent upon the wizard and can be stranded. Travel in the Astral Plane can be slow or fast, according to the wizard's desire. The ultimate
destination arrived at is subject to the conceptualization of the wizard. (See the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set for further information on the Astral Plane.)
  Any magical items can go into the Astral Plane, but most become temporarily nonmagical therein, or in any planes removed from the Prime Material Plane. Armor and weapons of +3 or better might function in other planes, at the DM's option. Artifacts and relics function anywhere. Items drawing their power from a given plane are more powerful in that plane (for example, a ring of fire resistance in the Elemental Plane of Fire or a sword of life stealing in the Negative Energy plane)."}</textarea>

"description":"  This powerful spell is similar to the 6th-level contingency spell.
  Chain contingency allows the caster to designate either two or three spells that will take effect automatically under a specific set of conditions.In other words, when a set of conditions is met, the designated spells are cast immediately without the caster's intervention.
  Chain contingency must be cast together with the spells it is to trigger.The caster may choose either two spells to occur simultaneously or three spells to occur consecutively, one per round.Spells must be of 8th level or lower. Only the 6th level contingency spell may not be included.The casting time of 2 turns includes the casting of the spells to be triggered.
  Unlike the contingency spell,spells 'stored' in chain contingency can affect creatures other than the caster.These instructions must be carefully worded;the spell obeys the letter of its instructions and not the caster's intentions. 
  In casting chain contingency, the wizard defines the conditions that will trigger the stored spells. This definition must be carefully worded but may be as limiting or general as the caster desires.The caster also states the exact order, target, range, and manner in which the stored spells are to be cast.
  The spell has several limitations in triggering its spells.It does not have any powers of discernment;thus,an instruction to target the highest level enemy is not possible.Furthermore, the conditions cannot involve a delay;a spell cannot be ordered to trigger three turns after 1 sneeze.
 When the named conditions are met,the chain contingency is automatically triggered. If all specifics of casting a spell are not specified.(e.g., target or area of effect),the effect is automatically centered on the caster.
 Possible triggers might include a fall from a distance greater than the caster's height,the appearance of the first beholder within 30 feet of the caster or the wizard pointing his finger and pronouncing a specified word.
  The material components are (in addition to those of the companion spells) 500 gp worth of quicksilver; a gem of at least 1000 gp value;a spell using creature and an ivory statuette of the wizard (which is not destroyed in the casting of the spell)which must be carried by the spellcaster in order for the chain contingency to perform its function when triggered."}</textarea>

If all specifics of casting a spell are not specified.(e.g., target or area of effect),the effect is automatically centered on the caster.<br /> Possible triggers might include a fall from a distance greater than the caster&#039;s height,the appearance of the first beholder within 30 feet of the caster or the wizard pointing his finger and pronouncing a specified word.<br />  The material components are (in addition to those of the companion spells) 500 gp worth of quicksilver; a gem of at least 1000 gp value;a spell using creature and an ivory statuette of the wizard (which is not destroyed in the casting of the spell)which must be carried by the spellcaster in order for the chain contingency to perform its function when triggered.</div>

"description":"  By casting this spell, the wizard opens a channel between the plane he is in and the Negative Energy plane, becoming the conductor between the two planes. As soon as he touches (equal to a hit if melee is involved) any living creature, the victim loses two levels (as if struck by a spectre). A monster loses 2 Hit Dice permanently, both for hit points and attack ability. A character loses levels, Hit Dice, hit points, and abilities permanently (until regained through adventuring, if applicable).
  The material component of this spell is essence of spectre or vampire dust. Preparation requires mere moments; the material component is then cast forth, and, upon touching the victim, the wizard speaks the triggering word, causing the spell to take effect instantly.
  The spell remains effective for only a single round. Humans or humanoids brought below zero energy levels by this spell can be animated as juju zombies under the control of the caster.
  The caster always has a 5% (1 in 20) chance to be affected by the dust, losing one point of Constitution at the same time as the victim is drained. When the number of Constitution points lost equals the caster's original Constitution ability score, the caster dies and becomes a shade."}</textarea>
